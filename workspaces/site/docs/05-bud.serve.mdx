Configure the development server.

## Server information

By default the server is available at this address:

| Property | Value     |
| -------- | --------- |
| host     | localhost |
| port     | 3000      |

## Usage

There is no need to call this function in order to use the development server. Development server functionality is automatically enabled when
the `bud serve` cli command is invoked.

This function is used to configure the development server to run at a different address or port, or to disable certain middleware functions.

## Specifying host and port

:::warning

You will need to handle resolving custom domains yourself if you don't want to use localhost.

:::

```ts title='bud.config.js'
bud.serve({
  host: 'my-local-site.example',
  port: 5000,
})
```

## Middleware

You may enable or disable middleware using the middleware key.

Example disabling all server middleware:

```ts title='bud.config.js'
bud.serve({
  middleware: {
    dev: false,
    hot: false,
    proxy: false,
  },
})
```
