## Overview

A webpack framework combining the best parts of Laravel Mix and Symfony Encore.

**洫ｳ roots/bud houses the webpack build tooling formerly integrated into the scaffolding tool now known as roots/clover.** If you are looking for the scaffolding tools you can find them at [https://github.com/roots/clover](roots/clover). These packages were born out of the same repository and it took a hot minute before we realized where everything belongs. Both packages are being bumped to v2.0.0 to reflect this change; sorry for any confusion.

## Installation

`yarn add @roots/bud --dev`

## Usage

```js
const {bud} = require('@roots/bud')

bud.bundle('app', ['app.js', 'app.css']).compile()
```

Bud can do many more things. But a central philosophy of the framework is that more is not always better for many common use cases.

## Plugins

### Usage

Import plugins at the top of your `bud.config.js` file

```js
const {eslint} = require('@roots/bud-eslint')
```

Then, utilize the `bud.use` method and register the plugin. Plugins will be called in the provided order.

```js
bud.use([eslint])
```

Some plugins may attach additional configuration methods to the `bud` object for you to utilize.

Obviously, you can't call a plugin-provided method without first registering that plugin, which is one of the reasons it's  generally a good idea to import and register everything at the top of your config.

```js
bud
  .use([dependencyExtraction])
  .dependencyExtraction({
    injectPolyfill: true,
  })
```

### First-party plugins

There are a number of Roots maintained plugins available to kickstart your projects.

## Alternative syntax

More advanced users may want to configure Bud's options more directly. The `@roots/bud-framework` container API allows for that.

Set the source directory path:

```js
bud.paths.set('src', path.join(__dirname, 'inputDir'))
```

Set filetypes for webpack to resolve:

```js
bud.options.set('webpack.resolve.extensions', ['.ts', '.tsx'])
```

Enable specific features:

```js
bud.features.set('hot', true)
```

## Hooks

Bud provides a system of 'hooks' to expose values in the webpack config for modification, replacement, testing, etc.

Here are some examples

```js
bud.hooks.on('webpack.externals', externals => ({
  $: 'jquery',
})

bud.hooks.on('webpack.output.filename', filename => '[name].[hash:4]')

bud.hooks.on('webpack.module.rules.css.test', /\.css$/)
```

You may also add new filters. This is probably most helpful in the context of authoring plugins.

```js
const filteredValue = bud.hooks.filter('plugin.filter.key', defaultValue)
```

Now, other plugins or the user can modify this value, same as above:

```js
bud.hooks.on('plugin.filter.key', defaultValue => defaultValue.shift())
```

## Developing

Most of the essentials are hooked to run as needed or will happen in CI, but here's the rundown:

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:roots/bud
```

Run a build:

```sh
yarn && yarn make
```

Test:

```sh
# just unit
yarn test

# with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# lcov
yarn test:coverage:lcov
```

Lint the project:

```sh
yarn lint
```

Refresh the changelog:

```sh
yarn changelog
```

Releases:

```sh
yarn release:[branch]:[tag]

# yarn release:next:pre => pre-release @next
# yarn release:latest => @latest
```

Lerna will determine the version based on PRs and commits.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from everyone.

We have [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/roots/guidelines/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get started.

**Some @roots/bud specifics:**

- [Open an issue first](https://github.com/roots/bud-support/issues/new/choose).
- Branch from `next`.
- A commit hook will guide you through the process of formatting your commit message. This is how the changelog is generated. Beneficial to have some[passing familiarity with semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/), at least conceptually.
