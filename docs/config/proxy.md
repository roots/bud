# bud.proxy

Users building on top of an existing backend framework like WordPress, Laravel, RoR, etc.
will likely want to proxy their established development server.

## Usage

`bud.proxy`, with nothing passed, will attempt to proxy `localhost:8000`.

```ts
bud.proxy();
```

Optionally, you may configure the host and port:

```ts
bud.proxy({
  host: "example.test",
  port: 8000,
});
```

You may explicitly enable or disable the proxy:

```ts
bud.proxy({ enabled: true });
```

To configure SSL, you will need to use `bud.proxy` in conjunction with [`bud.dev`](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/stable/docs/config/dev.md).

Note that SSL support is still considered experimental.
