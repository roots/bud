# Scaffolding template files

Bud core and extensions may provide templates to use in your project.

By default Bud provides an HTML starter as well as a `bud.config.js` starter.

Published templates will be written to a `publish` directory in your project root.

## Usage instructions

```sh
bud publish --help
```

## Starter configuration file

```sh
bud publish bud.config.js
```

## Starter HTML template

bud publish html
```
