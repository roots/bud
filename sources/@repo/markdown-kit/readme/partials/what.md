## Goals

**bud.js** wants to be:

- **Reliable**, yielding consistent and predictable behaviors regardless of specified options.
- **Fast**, leveraging parallel processing, smart caching and an asyncronous events based API to keep build times minimal.
- **Extensible**, with a fully featured plugin system to support an ecosystem of packaged modules.
- **Simple**, to get started and straight forward to maintain.

## Features

- Zero config by default. Check out this [codesandbox template with react, postcss modules and no config](https://codesandbox.io/s/bud-zero-config-or4tby).
- Modular by design. Use only what you need.
- Multi-compiler support.
- Heckin&rsquo; fast.
- Lux developer tooling and semi-automated dependency management.
- Support for configuration files authored with TypeScript, JSON, YML, CJS and ESM.
- Support for CDNs like skypack and unpkg.
- Customizable and extensible.
