**bud.js** is a javascript build framework with add-on support for Babel, React, PostCSS, Sass, Typescript, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, and more.

### Goals

**bud.js** wants to be:

- **Reliable**, yielding consistent and predictable behaviors regardless of specified options.
- **Fast**, leveraging parallel processing, smart caching and an asyncronous events based API to keep build times minimal.
- **Extensible**, with a fully featured plugin system to support an ecosystem of packaged modules
- **Simple**, to get started and straight forward to maintain

### Features

- Modular by design. Use only what you need.
- Easily implementable multi-compiler support.
- Heckin&rsquo; fast.
- Luxury dev tooling including semi-automated dependency management.
- Supports configuration with TypeScript.
