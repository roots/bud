Specify if a build is being run in a `production` or `development` context.

**bud.mode** will always be either `production` or `development`.

When running bud [using the cli](/learn/cli/):

- [bud build production](/learn/cli/build) will always run in `production`.
- [bud build development](/learn/cli/build) will always run in `development`.
