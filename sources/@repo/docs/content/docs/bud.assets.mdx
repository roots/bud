Include static assets in your compilation even if they aren't referenced in scripts or stylesheets.

You may specify a path to a specific file or use glob syntax to match many files at once.

## Usage

### Copying a file

Use a single `string` to specify a single file to copy. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images/image.png')
```

### Copying a directory

Use a single `string` to copy the entire images directory. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images')
```

### Copying using source/destination tuples

You can also specify the source and destination using a tuple.

The first item in each tuple is the source and the second is the destination:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets([
  [bud.path('@src/assets/asset.png'), bud.path('@dist/asset.png')],
  [bud.path('@src/fonts'), bud.path('@dist/fonts')],
])
```

For the destination, you may wish to utilize the `@name` handle to automatically reference the hashed filename in `production`.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets([[bud.path('@src/fonts'), bud.path('@dist/fonts/@name')]])
```

You can include the output path along with the name using `@file`. For example, this is the same as above:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets([bud.path('@src/fonts'), bud.path('@dist/@file')])
```

Both `@name` and `@file` work whether you are copying a directory or a single file.

### Copying using an object

You can specify [`CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin#patterns) object(s) directly:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets({
  from: bud.path('assets/some-file.svg'),
  to: bud.path('dist/some-file.svg'),
  noErrorOnMissing: false,
})
```

### Copying from multiple sources

To specify additional copy sources you can add additional parameters.

```ts title='bud.config.mjs'
bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
```

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
bud.assets([
  {
    from: bud.path('@src/images'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/images'),
  },
  {
    from: bud.path('@src/fonts'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/fonts'),
  },
])
```

## Merging existing assets

**bud.assets** can be called multiple times and the results will be merged onto the existing jobs.

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
bud
  .assets('fonts')
  .assets({
    from: bud.path('@src/svg'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/svg'),
  })
  .assets([[bud.path('@src/images'), bud.path('@dest/images')]])
```

## Additional information

You don't need to import assets which are utilized by your bundled code. For instance,
if you are referencing a font file from your stylesheet, the font will already be included
in your distribution. You don't need to manually require it with **bud.assets**, although
there is probably no real harm in doing so.

**bud.assets** is specifically for compiling files which are not already included elsewhere.

## Passing options directly

**bud.assets** is just a simple interface wrapper for the `copy-webpack-plugin` extension. You can utilize the extension directly:

```js title="bud.config.js"
bud.extensions
  .get('copy-webpack-plugin')
  .setOption('patterns', [{from: bud.path('@src/images')}])
```

It accepts any options that [copy-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin) does.
