Include static assets in your compilation even if they aren't referenced in scripts or stylesheets.

You may specify a path to a specific file or use glob syntax to match many files at once.

## Signature

This function is pretty flexible and accepts a few different ways of specifying what you want to copy.

```ts
  (
    ...request: Array<
      | string
      | CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern
      | Array<string | [string, string] | CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern>
    >
  ): Bud
```

## Usage

### Copying a file

Use a single `string` to specify a single file to copy. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images/image.png')
```

### Copying a directory

Use a single `string` to copy the entire images directory. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images')
```

### Copying using an object

You can specify `CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern` object(s) directly:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets({
  from: bud.path('assets/some-file.svg'),
  to: bud.path('dist/some-file.svg'),
  noErrorOnMissing: false,
})
```

### Copying using source/destination tuples

You can use an array of tuples to specify a set of copy jobs.

The first item in each tuple is the source and the second is the destination:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets([
  [bud.path('@src/assets/asset.png'), bud.path('@dist/asset.png')],
  [bud.path('@src/fonts'), bud.path('@dist/fonts')],
])
```

### Copying from multiple sources

To specify additional copy sources you can add additional parameters.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('fonts/**/*.woff', 'images')
```

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets(
  {
    from: bud.path('@src/images'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/images'),
  },
  {
    from: bud.path('@src/fonts'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/fonts'),
  },
)
```

You can also specify using an array, if preferred:

```ts
bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
```

The one exception to these rules is when using source/destination tuples (`[[from, to], [from, to]]`).

They must always be expressed using one parameter, which is an array.

## Merging existing assets

**bud.assets** can be called multiple times and the results will be merged onto the existing jobs.

```ts
bud
  .assets('fonts')
  .assets({
    from: bud.path('@src/svg'),
    to: bud.path('@dist/svg'),
  })
  .assets([[bud.path('@src/images'), bud.path('@dest/images')]])
```

## Additional information

You don't need to import assets which are utilized by your bundled code. For instance,
if you are referencing a font file from your stylesheet, the font will already be included
in your distribution. You don't need to manually require it with **bud.assets**, although
there is probably no real harm in doing so.

[bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) is specifically for compiling files which are not already included elsewhere.
