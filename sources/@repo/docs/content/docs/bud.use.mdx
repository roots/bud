Register an extension or set of extensions.

`bud.use` is an asyncronous function that takes a single argument, `extensions`. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `bud` instance.
You can register multiple extensions at once by passing an array of extensions.

If your extension is listed in `package.json` dependencies or devDependencies it is not necessary to call `bud.use` to use an extension.
The extensions will be discovered automatically before the configuration file is even loaded.

## Usage

Add bud extensions:

```js title='bud.config.js'
import babel from '@roots/bud-babel'
import react from '@roots/bud-react'

export default async bud => {
  bud.use(babel)
}
```

Add an extension inline (also works with an array of extensions):

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.use({
  name: 'my-webpack-plugin',
  make: () => new MyWebpackPlugin(),
})
```

Add a webpack plugin inline (also work with an array of plugins):

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.use(new MyWebpackPlugin())
```

Add an extension or plugin from its signifier (must be the default export):

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.use(`my-webpack-dashboard`)
```
