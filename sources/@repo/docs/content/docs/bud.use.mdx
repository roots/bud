Register an extension or set of extensions.

`bud.use` is an asyncronous function that takes a single argument, `extensions`. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `bud` instance.
You can register multiple extensions at once by passing an array of extensions.

It is not necessary to call `bud.use` to use an extension. The extensions will be discovered automatically before the configuration file is even loaded.

## Usage

Add packaged bud extensions:

```js
await bud.use([require('@roots/bud-babel'), require('@roots/bud-react')])
```

Add an extension inline (also works with an array of extensions):

```js
await bud.use({
  name: 'my-webpack-plugin',
  make: () => new MyWebpackPlugin(),
})
```

Add a webpack plugin inline (also work with an array of plugins):

```js
await bud.use(new MyWebpackPlugin())
```

## Signature

```ts title='@roots/bud-api/types/repository/index.d.ts'
namespace Repository {
  interface Use {
    (this: Framework, source: Use.Input): Promise<Framework>
  }

  namespace Use {
    type Input = Module | Module[]
  }
}
```
