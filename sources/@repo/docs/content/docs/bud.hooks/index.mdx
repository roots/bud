description: Modify internal bud values with callbacks.
---

**bud.hooks** allows for modifying values with callbacks. This is useful for things like logging, or for modifying a value before it is used.

## bud.hooks.on

Callbacks and raw values are registered with `bud.hooks.on`

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.hooks.on('build.externals', externals => ({
  ...externals,
  $: 'jquery',
})
```

`bud.hooks.on` takes two parameters:

- The `name` of the hook.
- A function to filter the associated value through.

## bud.hooks.fromMap

Set multiple hooks at once with `bud.hooks.fromMap`.

```ts
bud.hooks.fromMap({
  'build.node': false,
  'build.resolve.extensions': ext => ext.add('.mjml'),
})
```

## bud.hooks.filter

Filters are registered with `bud.hooks.filter`.

```js
const result = bud.hooks.filter('my.filter.key', value)
```

`bud.hooks.filter` takes two parameters:

- The `name` of the `filter` to hook onto.
- The `value` which is being filtered. If there is nothing hooked to this filter, the value will be returned as-is.

## bud.hooks.async

Some hooks are asynchronous. An example of this are values for `build.resolve.modules`:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.hooks.async('build.resolve.modules', async modulePaths => [
  ...modulePaths,
  await fs.promises.realpath('node_modules'),
])
```

Callbacks for asynchronous hooks should be registered as asynchronous functions.

## bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap

Set multiple async hooks at once with `bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap`.

```ts
bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap({
  'build.resolve.modules': async paths => [
    ...paths,
    abud.path('@modules'),
  ],
})
```

## bud.hooks.action

Actions are registered with `bud.hooks.action`.

```js
bud.hooks.action('my.action.key', async bud => {
  bud.log('action log') // do something
})
```

All actions are asynchronous. The order of execution is not guaranteed.

## bud.hooks.fire

Actions are fired with `bud.hooks.fire`.

```js
await bud.hooks.fire('my.action.key')
```

This function returns a `Promise`.
