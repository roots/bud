Bud provides a system of 'hooks' to expose values for modification.

## bud.hooks.on

Hooks are defined as functions. Hook functions are registered with `bud.hooks.on`

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.hooks.on('build/externals', externals => ({
  ...externals,
  $: 'jquery',
})
```

`bud.hooks.on` takes two parameters:

- The `name` of the hook.
- A function to filter the associated value through.

## bud.hooks.filter

Filters are registered with `bud.hooks.filter`.

`bud.hooks.filter` takes two parameters:

- The `name` of the `filter` to hook onto.
- The `value` which is being filtered

### Usage

A `value` is passed through the `my.filter.key` filter.

```js
const filteredValue = bud.hooks.filter('my.filter.key', value)
```

Now, the user and other extensions have access to this value and can modify it.

```js
bud.hooks.on('my.filter.key', value => value.shift())
```
