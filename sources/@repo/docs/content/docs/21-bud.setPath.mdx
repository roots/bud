Configures registered project paths.

Once set, this directory may be utilitized using [bud.path](/docs/bud.path).

## Params

The first is a location registered with the framework:

- `project`
- `src`
- `dist`
- `storage`

It is possible for extensions to register additional locations.

- The second is the path being assigned to this location. If `project` is being defined this path should be absolute. All other paths should be supplied as relative to `project`.

Alternatively, this function may also accept a key-value object, so that multiple locations can be defined at once.

## Usage

Define the `src` directory as `scripts` (relative to project root).

```js
bud.setPath('src', 'scripts')
```

Define both the `src` and `dist` directories in one call:

```js
bud.setPath({
  src: 'scripts',
  dist: 'public',
})
```
