**bud** includes support for utilizing dotenv values in your configuration, html templates and application code.

Environment variable values are sourced from an `.env` file located in the project root.

## Accessing env values from the config file

Values defined in the application `.env` file are available via `bud.env`.

The `bud.env` object is a container instance.

Most commonly you'll probably find yourself using these methods:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.env.get('APP_NAME')
```

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.env.is('APP_ENV', 'production')
```

## Accessing env values from within a template

Values defined in the application `.env` file are available within HTML templates ([see `bud.template` for more information on HTML templating](/docs/bud.template)).

## Accessing env values from within the application

Any .env values with a key starting with `PUBLIC_` will be available within the application globally.

```env title='.env'
PUBLIC_APP_NAME="My App"
```

The `PUBLIC_APP_NAME` envvar will be available as `APP_NAME` in application source files. This replacement is static, and happens during the build.

```js title='bud.config.js'
console.log(APP_NAME)
```
