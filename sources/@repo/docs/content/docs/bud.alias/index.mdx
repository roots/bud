Register shorthand for resolving modules.

Useful for situations that may otherwise require brittle relative paths.

## Usage

As an example, imagine a file located at `scripts/my-feature/components/example/index.js` that is importing a function from `scripts/util.js`.

This import statement is very lengthy and fragile.

```js title='scripts/my-feature/components/example/index.js'
import {merge} from '../../../util'
```

So, we can use [bud.alias](/docs/bud.alias) to create a reference to `./src/scripts`.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.alias({
  '@scripts': bud.path('src', 'scripts'),
})
```

And use the reference to import the module.

```js title='scripts/my-feature/components/example/index.js'
import {merge} from '@scripts/util'
```

This can prove especially useful later, should we have cause to move **scripts/my-feature/components/example/index.js**.

Without the alias we would need to rework the relative path between the two files. But, since the alias is independent of the path of the importing file, we don't have to deal with that.

## Signature

```ts title='bud.alias.d.ts'
type Alias = (
  this: Framework
  alias: Webpack.Configuration['resolve']['alias']
) => Framework
```
