Include static assets in your compilation even if they aren't referenced in scripts or stylesheets.

You may specify a path to a specific file or use glob syntax to match many files at once.

## Signature

This function is pretty flexible and accepts a few different ways of specifying what you want to copy.

```ts
(paths:
  | string
  | CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern
  | Array<string | CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern>,
): Framework
```

## Usage

Use a single `string` to specify a single file to copy. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images/image.png')
```

Use a single `string` to copy the entire images directory. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('images')
```

Copy only `.woff` files found in `src/fonts` and the images directory. Relative to source dir.

```js title='bud.config.js'
// you can add as many arguments as you'd like
bud.assets('fonts/**/*.woff', 'images')
// or, use an array
bud.assets(['fonts/**/*.woff', 'images'])
```

Copy a file relative to the project root with a leading `./`.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('./assets/some-file.svg')
```

Copy a file with an absolute path.

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets('/srv/www/project/assets/some-file.svg')

// or, use the bud.path utility
bud.assets(bud.path('project', 'assets/some-file.svg'))
```

Specify the job using a `CopyPlugin.ObjectPattern` object:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.assets({
  from: './assets/some-file.svg',
  to: './dist/some-file.svg',
})
```

Or some combination:

```js
bud.assets(
  'image.jpg',
  {
    from: './assets/some-file.svg',
    to: './dist/some-file.svg',
  },
  './assets/another-file.svg',
)
```

## Additional information

You don't need to import assets which are utilized by your bundled code. For instance,
if you are referencing a font file from your stylesheet, the font will already be included
in your distribution. You don't need to manually require it with **bud.assets**, although
there is probably no real harm in doing so.

[bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) is specifically for compiling files which are not already included elsewhere.
