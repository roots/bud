title: bud.path
description: Returns an absolute path to a directory or file.

You can use **bud.path** to reference a file or directory's absolute path.

## Usage

```ts
bud.path('./src/scripts/components')
```

You may also choose to deliniate directories with an `Array` of path segments, rather than a `String`:

```ts
bud.path('./src', 'scripts', 'components')
```

## Special path handles

The following is a table containing `string` values which fulfill a special role in the context of the **bud.path** function:

| handle       | description                      | default          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **@src**     | source directory                 | `./src`          |
| **@dist**    | destination directory            | `./dist`         |
| **@storage** | cache/artifact storage directory | `./.budfiles`    |
| **@modules** | modules directory                | `./node_modules` |

When one of these handles is used at **the beginning of a string path** (or the first segment in a multi-segment path), the path will be
prefixed with the corresponding directory.

For example, to reference the `./src` directory:

```ts
bud.path('@src/scripts/components')
```

You can create your own handles for use in the **bud.path** function. But, the handles in this table are standard.
Other parts of bud.js or its ecosystem may use these handles to reference project directories. So, while they may be freely modified as needed, they should not be removed or repurposed.

## Internal handles

There are a few handles used internally by **bud.js**:

| handle         | description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **@os-cache**  | absolute path to project folder in os cache directory     |
| **@os-temp**   | absolute path to project folder in os tempfiles directory |
| **@os-data**   | absolute path to project folder in os data directory      |
| **@os-log**    | absolute path to project folder in os log directory       |
| **@os-config** | absolute path to project folder in os config directory    |

These handles should be considered read-only.
