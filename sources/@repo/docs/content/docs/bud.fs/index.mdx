`bud.fs` is a collection of utilities to help with common filesystem based tasks.

All `bud.fs` functions take paths relative to the project's root directory. You can also create new instances with
a different context using `bud.fs.make`. This is useful for code readability if you have a bunch of tasks to do relative to a particular directory:

```typescript
const source = bud.fs.make(bud.path(`@src`)) // make a new bud.fs instance with a root in `src`
await source.copy(`foo`, `bar`) // copy src/foo to src/bar
await source.write(`hello.txt`, `hello world`) // write `hello world` to src/hello.txt
```

Additionally, `bud.fs` includes built-in support for working with remote files stored in S3. It is compatible with Digital Ocean Spaces.

Example which will automatically upload `@dist` to S3 (and delete files from outdated builds):

```typescript
app.fs
  .setCredentials({
    accessKeyId: `***`,
    secretAccessKey: `***`,
  })
  .setEndpoint(`https://sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com`)
  .setBucket('my-bucket')
  .upload()
```

[See bud.fs.s3 documentation](s3) for more information on how to use these features.
