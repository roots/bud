Write a file from the filesystem.

## Usage

`bud.fs.write` takes a minimum of two arguments:

- `path` - The path to the file to write
- `content` - The content to write to the file

```typescript
await bud.fs.write(`readme.md`, `# Hello, world!`)
```

If you pass an object as the `content` parameter it will be written as `json`.

```typescript
await bud.fs.write(`demo.json`, {foo: 'bar'})
```

In addition to the two required arguments, `bud.fs.write` also takes an optional third argument for
options:

```typescript
type WriteOptions = {
  mode?: string | number
  atomic?: boolean
  jsonIndent?: number
}
```

```typescript
await bud.fs.write(`demo.json`, {foo: 'bar'}, {spaces: 2})
```
