`bud.fs.s3` is a collection of utilities for working with the S3 cloud storage API.

Several common operations are available through `bud.fs` directly (for convenience), but the full API is available through `bud.fs.s3`.

## Aliased functions

| Alias                   | Function                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `bud.fs.setCredentials` | [`bud.fs.s3.setCredentials`](setCredentials) |
| `bud.fs.setEndpoint`    | [`bud.fs.s3.setEndpoint`](setEndpoint)       |
| `bud.fs.setRegion`      | [`bud.fs.s3.setRegion`](setRegion)           |
| `bud.fs.setBucket`      | [`bud.fs.s3.setBucket`](setBucket)           |

## Setup

Digital Ocean users will want to specify the endpoint:

```typescript
app.fs
  .setCredentials({
    accessKeyId: `***`,
    secretAccessKey: `***`,
  })
  .setEndpoint(`https://sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com`)
  .setBucket('my-bucket')
```

AWS users will want to specify the region:

```typescript
app.fs
  .setCredentials({
    accessKeyId: `***`,
    secretAccessKey: `***`,
  })
  .setRegion('us-east-1')
  .setBucket('my-bucket')
```

There is likely no need to set both. Unless you know what you're doing this is likely a mistake.

## Uploading files

`bud.fs.upload` is a synchronous function that can be used to upload files to S3 without having to mess with streams or buffers.

In fact, if you are only wanting to upload the contents of your `dist` directory to S3, you can call `bud.fs.upload` with no arguments.

```typescript
bud.fs.upload()
```

This function takes an optional `options` object, which can be used to dial in the defaults, if needed.

```typescript
app.fs.upload({
  /* Directory to upload (local path) */
  source: app.path(`@dist`),

  /* Upload to a specific directory in the bucket (remote path) */
  destination: `bucket/path`,

  /* Limit to matching files */
  files: '**/*.js',

  /* Keep the assets from the most recent x builds */
  keep: 5,
})
```

### the `keep` option

The `keep` option is a special option that can be used to keep only the most recent `x` builds in the bucket. By default `keep` is set to `5`.

When used, bud.js tracks the most recent builds in a file named `uploads-manifest.json`, stored in the root of the bucket. Each entry value lists all of the compilation assets in a one-dimensional array. The keys are the time of the corresponding compilation.

Before uploading, bud.js checks the length of the tracked entries. if it exceeds the value specified by `keep`, bud.js makes a copy of the array items which are slated to be deleted and then deletes the oldest build from the manifest's entries.

Then, it checks each of the assets from the deleted manifest entry against all the other entries which remain. If an asset is still a part of the any of the remaining entries, it is not deleted. If an asset is now orphaned (no reference remaining), it will be deleted.

In other words, an asset will be deleted when:

- It is currently a part of a build in `uploads-manifest.json`
- It will no longer be a part of any build in `uploads-manifest.json` after the current compilation

If bud.js attempts to delete an asset and it is not present in the bucket (for example: manually renamed or moved), it will silently move on to the next item.

bud.js will not attempt to delete any file which is not listed in `uploads-manifest.json`. It is prefererred to keep a bucket solely for usage with the bud s3 uploader, but it should be safe to put other files in the bucket.

If `uploads-manifest.json` is deleted bud will have no way of knowing which files were once a part of a build and will ignore everything. It will begin tracking again on the next compilation but any stale files will need to be dealt with manually.

To disable tracking, you can pass `false` as the value of `keep`:

```typescript
app.fs.upload({
  source: app.path(`@dist`),
  /* will not attempt to manage assets */
  keep: false,
})
```
