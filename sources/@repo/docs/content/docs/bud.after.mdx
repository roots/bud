description: Do something after compilation has completed
---

**bud.after** can be used to do tasks after a compilation has completed.

The callback it accepts is asynchronous, but `bud.after` itself is synchronous.

## Usage

```typescript title='bud.config.js'
export default async bud => {
  bud.after(async bud => {
    // Do something after the compilation has completed
  })
}
```
