**bud.js** is a web-focused build tool with add-on support for Babel, React, PostCSS, Sass, Typescript, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, and more.

## Requirements

<div className="card">
  <div className="card__body">
    <ul>
      <li>node.js LTS</li>
      <li>yarn, npm or pnpm</li>
      <li>Windows users must use Windows Subsystem for Linux</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Creating a new project

The easiest way to get started with bud.js is to use the [create-bud-app](/learn/create-bud-app) command.

```bash
npx create-bud-app my-app
```

## Adding to an existing project

Add **@roots/bud** as a development dependency using your choice of package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud --save-dev
```

:::info

If you are using pnpm add `--public-hoist-pattern=*` to the installation command and [use our .pnpmfile.cjs compatibility shim](/learn/general-use/pnpm#pnpmfilecjs-compatibilty-shim).

## Building your project

If your project's entrypoint is located at `./src/index.(js|css)` you can now compile it using the [bud build](./cli/build/index.mdx) command.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run bud build
```

No configuration is required. The bundled code will be output to `./dist/main.(js|css)`.

If you are using a different entrypoint, you can learn about how to add it in the [configuration guide](/learn/configure).

## Adding support for languages, frameworks and tools

**bud.js** is built modularly. This means features can be added as needed by adding extensions to your project.

The [configuration basics](configure) guide has more information on how to add extensions, but most of them start and end with installing a package.

For example, you can add swc and postcss support by
installing [@roots/bud-swc](/extensions/bud-swc) and [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss/):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-swc @roots/bud-postcss --save-dev
```

Consult the [extensions directory](/extensions/) for available first-party extensions.

## Upgrading bud.js

In general, all dependencies with the `@roots/*` namespace should share the same version.

To make it easy to keep versions in sync you can use the [bud upgrade](./cli/index.mdx) command.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run bud upgrade
```
