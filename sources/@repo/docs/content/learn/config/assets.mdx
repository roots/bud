:::info No need to copy imported assets

If you are already including assets by importing them in a script or stylesheet, you do not need
to copy them explicitly.

For example, given this stylesheet, copying `@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2` would be unnecessary:

```js title='index.css'
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src: url(@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2) format('woff2');
}
```

:::

The [bud.assets](/reference/bud.assets) function is used to copy files to the output directory.

The simplest way to use it is to pass an array of directories (relative to [your project `@src` directory](#project-paths)) you would like to copy:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
}
```

If you want more control over the directory being output to, you can use an array of from/to pairs:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets([
    ['images', 'assets/images'], // from `@src/images` to `@dist/assets/images`
    ['fonts', 'assets/fonts'], // from `@src/fonts` to `@dist/assets/fonts`
  ])
}
```

For complete control, you can pass an object:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets({
    from: bud.path(`@src`, 'images'),
    to: bud.path(`@dist`, 'images', `@name`), // `@name` is the filename (including hash if applicable)
    context: bud.path(`@src`),
    noErrorOnMissing: true,
    toType: `template`,
  })
```

You can learn more about this and other details in the [bud.assets documentation](/reference/bud.assets).
