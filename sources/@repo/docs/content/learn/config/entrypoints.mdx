bud.js uses the concept of "entrypoints" to group application scripts and styles. Entrypoints are defined using [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry).

You can think of an entrypoint as a "page" in your application. Each entrypoint will have its own output file.

:::info

If your application's entrypoint is located at `@src/index.js` then you don't need to do anything. bud.js will automatically
detect this and create an entrypoint for you.

:::

If you only have a single entrypoint then it is enough to just pass the filename:

<ConfigExample title="bud.config">

```ts
bud.entry('app')
```

```js
bud.entry('app')
```

```yml
entry: app
```

```json title=bud.config.json
{
  "entry": "app"
}
```

</ConfigExample>

If you have more than one file to include in the bundle, you can use an array:

<ConfigExample title="bud.config">

  ```ts
  bud.entry(['app.js', 'global.css'])
  ```

  ```js
  bud.entry(['app.js', 'global.css'])
  ```

  ```yml
  entry:
    - ['app.js', 'global.css']
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "entry": [["app.js", "global.css"]]
  }
  ```

</ConfigExample>

If you have additional entrypoints you may call [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry) multiple times.

But, it might be preferable to use an object:

<ConfigExample title="bud.config">

  ```ts
  bud.entry({
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css'],
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css'],
  })
  ```

  ```js
  bud.entry({
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css'],
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css'],
  })
  ```

  ```yml
  entry:
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css']
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css']
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "entry": {
      "app": ["app.js", "global.css"],
      "landing": ["landing.js", "landing.css"]
    }
  }
  ```

</ConfigExample>

There is still more that this function can do, but for our overview this is more than enough. You can learn more about this and
other details in the [bud.entry documentation](/reference/bud.entry).

## Entrypoints manifest

When you build your application, bud.js will generate a manifest file that contains a list of all the entrypoints and their
corresponding output files. This file is located at `@dist/entrypoints.json`.

```json title=dist/entrypoints.json
{
  "app": {
    "js": ["app.js"],
    "css": ["app.css"]
  },
  "landing": {
    "js": ["landing.js"],
    "css": ["landing.css"]
  }
}
```

You can use this file to load your application scripts and styles using server-side languages like PHP or Ruby.
