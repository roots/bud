bud.js uses the concept of "entrypoints" to group application scripts and styles. Entrypoints are defined using [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry).

You can think of an entrypoint as a "page" in your application. Each entrypoint will have its own output file.

:::info

If your application's entrypoint is located at `@src/index.js` then you don't need to do anything. bud.js will automatically
detect this and create an entrypoint for you.

:::

If you only have a single entrypoint then it is enough to just pass the filename:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry('app') // src/app.js
}
```

If you have more than one file to include in the bundle, you can use an array:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry(['app.js', 'global.css'])
}
```

If you have additional entrypoints you may call [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry) multiple times.

But, it might be preferable to use an object:

```js title=bud.config.js
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry({
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css'],
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css'],
  })
}
```

There is still more that this function can do, but for our overview this is more than enough. You can learn more about this and
other details in the [bud.entry documentation](/reference/bud.entry).
