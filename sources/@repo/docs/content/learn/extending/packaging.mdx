Your package's name should begin with `bud-`. This is important for discoverability.

```json title=package.json
{"name": "bud-extension"}
```

The extension should be the package's `default` export:

```json title=package.json
{
  "name": "bud-extension",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./lib/index.js"
  }
}
```
