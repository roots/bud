## Installing bud.js dependencies

To get started with TailwindCSS, install the [@roots/bud-tailwindcss](/extensions/bud-tailwindcss) extension to your project along with [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-postcss @roots/bud-tailwindcss --save-dev
```

## Configuration

No configuration is required. If you need to customize your TailwindCSS configuration, you can do so by creating a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project.

Refer to the [TailwindCSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for general information on configuring TailwindCSS.
