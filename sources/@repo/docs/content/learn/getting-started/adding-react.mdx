## Installing bud.js dependencies

To get started with React, install the [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react) extension to your project along with a compatible compiler:

- [@roots/bud-babel](/extensions/bud-babel)
- [@roots/bud-esbuild](/extensions/bud-esbuild)
- [@roots/bud-swc](/extensions/bud-swc)
- [@roots/bud-typescript](/extensions/bud-typescript)

We recommend using [@roots/bud-swc](/extensions/bud-swc):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-swc @roots/bud-typescript --save-dev
```

If you need to further customize React for your application, reference the [@roots/bud-react documentation](/extensions/bud-react).

## Installing production dependencies

React requires installing `react` and `react-dom` as production dependencies.

We will try and resolve them for you but it is a good idea to install them as explicit dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react react-dom --save
```
