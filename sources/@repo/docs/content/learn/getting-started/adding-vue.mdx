## Installing bud.js dependencies

To get started with Vue, install the [@roots/bud-vue](/extensions/bud-vue) extension to your project.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-vue --save-dev
```

If you need to further customize Vue for your application, reference the [@roots/bud-vue documentation](/extensions/bud-vue).

## Installing production dependencies

Vue requires installing `vue` as production dependencies.

We will try and resolve this for you but it is a good idea to install it as an explicit dependency:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install vue --save
```

## Configuration

No configuration is required.

### Using Vue 2 instead of Vue 3

A Vue 3 project can just install **@roots/bud** and **@roots/bud-vue** and everything should be perfectly set up. But, at least for now, in order to use Vue 2, you'll need to override the peer dependencies that **@roots/bud-vue** ships with:

- vue (2.6.14)
- vue-template-compiler (2.6.14)
- vue-loader (15.9.4)

```sh npm2yarn
npm install vue@2.6.14 vue-template-compiler@2.6.14 vue-loader@15.9.4 --save-dev
```

If you need to further customize the provided defaults refer to the [@roots/bud-vue documentation](/extensions/bud-vue).
