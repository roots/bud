**bud.js** is a web-focused build tool with add-on support for Babel, React, PostCSS, Sass, Typescript, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, and more.

## Requirements

  <div className="card__body">
    <ul>
      <li>Node LTS</li>

## Creating a new project

The easiest way to get started with bud.js is to use the [create-bud-app command](/learn/getting-started/create-bud-app).

```bash
npx create-bud-app my-app
```

## Adding to an existing project

Add **@roots/bud** as a development dependency using your choice of package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud --save-dev
```

:::info

If you are using pnpm add `--public-hoist-pattern=*` to the installation command and [use our .pnpmfile.cjs compatibility shim](/learn/general-use/pnpm#pnpmfilecjs-compatibilty-shim).

## Building your project

If your project's entrypoint is located at `./src/index.js` you can now compile it using the [bud build](/cli/build/index.mdx) command.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run bud build
```

No configuration is required. The bundled code will be output to `./dist/*`.

If your application entrypoint is not located at `./src/index.js`, you can learn about how to configure it with [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry) it in the [Entrypoints guide](/learn/config/entrypoints).

## Upgrading bud.js

In general, all dependencies with the `@roots/*` namespace should share the same version.

To make it easy to keep versions in sync you can use the [bud upgrade](/cli/upgrade.mdx) command.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run bud upgrade
```
