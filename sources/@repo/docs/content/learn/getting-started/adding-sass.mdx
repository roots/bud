## Installing bud.js dependencies

To get started with Sass, install the [@roots/bud-sass](/extensions/bud-sass) extension.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-sass --save-dev
```

If you need to further customize Sass for your application, reference the [@roots/bud-sass documentation](/extensions/bud-sass).
