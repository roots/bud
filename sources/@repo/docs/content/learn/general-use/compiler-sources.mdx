By default, **bud.js** only resolves source code from [the `@src` directory](/reference/bud.path).

Nearly all of the modules you install will have been compiled before they are published. It's almost always a waste to run this code through Babel or whatever other compiler you may be using.

Nevertheless, some packages expect to be compiled from source. We can allow for this with the **bud.build.rules** API.

Common examples:

- [highlight.js](https://npmjs.org/package/highlight.js)
- [swiper](https://npmjs.org/package/swiper)
- various scss frameworks
- a project that needs to source modules from multiple directories

## Adding sources

:::info bud.compilePaths

There is a function to simplify this available in bud@6.9.0: [bud.compilePaths](/reference/bud.compilePaths).

:::

You should make modifications to compiler sources within a `build.before` action.
Some extensions may not register build rules until after the config file is processed;
using this hook will guarantee that your customization takes precedence.

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`build.before`, async bud => {
  bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
    bud.path('@src'),
    bud.path('@modules/some-untranspiled-pkg'),
  ])
})
```

Or, you can be broad:

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`build.before`, async bud => {
  bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([bud.path('@src'), bud.path('@modules')])
})
```

Apply the above change to all registered rules:

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`build.before`, async bud => {
  Object.values(bud.build.rules).map(rule =>
    rule.setInclude([bud.path('@src'), bud.path('@modules')]),
  )
})
```

In general, we would advise being as restrictive as possible when it comes to whitelisting transpiler sources.
