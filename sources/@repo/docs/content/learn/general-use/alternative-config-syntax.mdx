In addition to `.js`, `.cjs` and `.mjs` configurations, **bud.js** supports configuration files authored with TypeScript, [json5](https://json5.org/) and yml.

## TypeScript

You can use TypeScript to configure your build regardless of if you are using TypeScript in your project. The config file is not typechecked.

You can import the `Bud` types from `@roots/bud`.

```ts
import type {Bud} from '@roots/bud'

export default async (bud: Bud) => {
  // configure bud
}
```

By default bud.js uses [esbuild-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-wasm) to transpile the config file when authored with TypeScript.

If you prefer you can install [esbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild) and it will be used instead automatically.

The esbuild team advises that using esbuild is faster than esbuild-wasm, but the benefit of esbuild-wasm is that it doesn't need to be compiled during installation.
Additionally, results of the transform are cached, so either way the transformer is only invoked a single time.
In our testing the extra installation time outweighs the performance gains.

## YML

Each key is a reference to a `Bud` call. The supplied values are the arguments to that call.

For instance, the equivalent of the following call to [bud.entry](/reference/bud.entry):

```js
bud.entry('app', 'app.js')
```

Would be:

```yml
entry: ['app', 'app.js']
```

There is some flexibility here if you are passing a single value and it is NOT an array. So, this is okay:

```yml
entry:
  app: app.js
```

But, this would cause an error. it will be parsed as if it were a multi-parameter call:

```yml
# This is incorrect
assets: ['src/**/*.html', 'app/**/*.html']
```

You can access nested properties no problem.

```yml
babel:
  setPluginOptions:
    - '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime'
    - {helpers: true}
```

### Referencing bud.js values

You can make reference to the `bud` object with `_bud`.

```yml
splitChunks: _bud.isProduction
```

You can tap `bud` with an arrow fn if needed. These functions will be called
as they are encountered and supplied with the bud.js instance.

```yml
minimize: bud => bud.isProduction
```

### Treating a value as a function

You can prefix a string with `=>` to indicate that it should be treated as a function. These functions will be called
as they are encountered.

This will log `4`:

```yml
log: => 2 + 2
```

### Handling callbacks

Some functions accept functions as a value. In cases like these wrap the function in an additional `=>` so that the
config parser does not call the function itself.

```yml
webpackConfig: >
  => config => ({...config, parallelism: 1})
```

[bud.tap](/reference/bud.tap) and [bud.tapAsync](/reference/bud.tapAsync) can be helpful for dynamic configuration and work like this:

```yml
tap: >
  => bud => {
    // this is a very flexible
    // area to do all sorts of dynamic config stuff
    bud.log('hi!')
  }

tapAsync: >
  => async bud => {
    // same as above but async
    bud.log('hi!', '...eventually')
  }
```

If you're doing a lot of this remember that you can create JS configurations in addition to the yml one.

## JSON

JSON works by the same rules as yml and you can use json5 syntax (comments, non-quoted keys).

```json
{
  "entry": ["app", ["app.js"]],
  "runtime": [true],
  "assets": [["src/**/*.html"]],
  "babel": {
    "setPluginOptions": [
      "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime",
      {"helpers": false, "regenerator": false}
    ]
  }
}
```

If you are doing a lot of dynamic configuration you may find it easier to use YML or JS. Ultimately, it's your choice, but
we recommend using yml over json for more complicated configs.
