This guide covers using CSS modules in your **bud.js** app.

By default, **bud.js** only ships with support for [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

However, support for CSS preprocessors can be added via extensions.

## PostCSS

Support for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) can be added to **bud.js** by installing the [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss) extension.

```npm2yarn
yarn add @roots/bud-postcss --dev
```

Once installed your stylesheets will be processed with postcss. The default configuration supports nested syntax, postcss-imports and autoprefixer.

Refer to the [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss) documentation for more information.

## Sass

Support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) can be added to **bud.js** by installing the [@roots/bud-sass](/extensions/bud-sass) extension.

```npm2yarn
yarn add @roots/bud-sass --dev
```

Once installed your `.scss` and `.sass` files will be processed with dart-sass.

Refer to the [@roots/bud-sass](/extensions/bud-sass) documentation for more information.
