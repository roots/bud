import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

This major release transitions **bud.js** to ESM. It also provides some cool new features (like importing from remote sources),
but we'll mainly be talking about the new ESM syntax.

<!--truncate-->

## Introduction

The transition to EcmaScript modules is causing a lot of division and drama in the JS world, at the moment.
Having just finished transitioning all of the nearly 50 packages that make up the **bud.js** monorepo to use
ESM I can say in all honesty that I totally get it. It was a very frustrating experience.

Which is to say, whatever problems come up with this release, let's work together as a community to help one another
get through it. There will be problems. I hope not a lot, but this is the type of transition that happens every twenty
years, _maybe_. And I can assure you, on the other side of throwing `require` out the window, it feels good to be on the
future-facing side of a great schism like this one.

I hope the appeal for solidarity wasn't too spooky because the good news is that, for the vast majority of
**bud.js** users, not much is required here.

See ["that sindresorhus README"](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) for more context.

## Upgrade guide

There are three upgrade paths available to JS users:

1. [Keep your config file the same and use the `.cjs` extension](#keep-your-config-file-the-same-and-use-the-cjs-extension)
2. [Update your config file to use ESM syntax and use the `.mjs` extension](#update-your-config-file-to-use-esm-syntax-and-use-the-extension-mjs)
3. [Transition your project to ESM](#transition-your-entire-project-to-esm)

Things are a litle different for users with configuration files authored in TypeScript, and [we'll get to that](#typescript-configs).

### Keep your config file the same and use the `.cjs` extension

This is the simplest possible path forward. Update `bud.config.js` to `bud.config.cjs`.

Caveat: you cannot `require` code from `@roots/bud` or any first-party extension. Mostly **bud.js** is structured so
this isn't a normal use case, but if you are using a require statement you'll want to read up on
[how to import esm from commonjs](#importing-esm-from-commonjs).

### Update your config file to use ESM syntax and use the extension `.mjs`.

This is probably my recommended approach. Update `bud.config.js` to `bud.config.mjs`.

Update your config function to use the ESM `export` syntax:

```js title="bud.config.js"
module.exports = async bud => bud.entry('app', 'index')
```

becomes:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
export default async bud => bud.entry('app', 'index')
```

### Transition your project to ESM

This is the most involved approach. There is no way I can cover it fully in this release post. But, I will try to sketch it out:

First, add a `type` field to `package.json` indicating your project is opting in to ESM:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "project",
  "type": "module"
}
```

Then update `bud.config.js` to use `export` syntax as described above.

You will also need to update all other files in your project accordingly. Some build tools allow for using `export` syntax. Others do not.

For example, `stylelint` does not support `export`. So you will update `stylelint.config.js` to `stylelint.config.cjs`.

Jest, on the other hand, does support `export`. You will either want to update your jest config file to use ESM `export` syntax or rename it to `jest.config.cjs`.

Check the documentation for each tool. Read up on ESM.

## TypeScript guide

### Update config to either `bud.config.mts` or `bud.config.cts`

TypeScript 4.7.2 offers two new TypeScript extensions to deal with CJS/ESM compatibility issues: `.cts` and `.mts` (they have their own declaration file extensions as well: `.d.cts` and `.d.mts`).

In general, I'd imagine most TS users already author their `bud.config.ts` file with `export` syntax. If that's the case, you will likely just want to update the file name to `bud.config.mts`.

### Use `ts-bud` instead of `bud`

:::danger Known issue

**`bud.typescript.typecheck.enable()` will die when using `ts-bud`**

It is unclear what the problem is as of right now ([see #1480](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/1480)). **In order to enable typechecking you must author your config file in JS until this is resolved.**

:::

**Due to the way ESM modules are loaded you'll need to use `ts-bud` instead of `bud` when running cli commands.** Explanation follows:

A problem with TypeScript and ESM: it is not possible to hack `import` at runtime the way we can hack `require` at runtime.

**bud.js** uses [ts-node](https://github.com/typestrong/ts-node) to import TS configs when it is available, but with ESM we also need to register an `import` loader so that the config file can be parsed. This can't be done at runtime.

[ts-node](https://github.com/typestrong/ts-node) offers a flag to set this up:

```bash title="shell"
ts-node --esm --transpileOnly
```

And **bud.js** offers a `bin` that wraps the standard `bud` command accordingly: `ts-bud`. Use it instead of `bud`.

If this doesn't work for you, or you need to adjust other `ts-node` flags, you may do this yourself:

```sh title="shell"
ts-node --esm --transpileOnly ./node_modules/.bin/bud build
```

## Notes on import vs. require in the context of **bud.js**

For the most part this shouldn't be an issue. It isn't typical to import or require **bud.js** code from a project config.

There are exceptions however. For example, if you are using the **bud.js** node api to generate a config for use with the `webpack-cli`.

### Updating `require` statements to `import`

If you are writing a config file with `.mjs` or you have opted in with `"type": "module"`, you will no longer
be able to `require` modules or packages in your config file.

The great news is that it's totally possible import CommonJS from an ES Module, so you can convert `require` statements to use `import` without worrying about it too much:

```js title="bud.config.cjs"
const value = require('browsersync-webpack-plugin')
```

becomes:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
import value from 'browsersync-webpack-plugin'
```

### Importing ESM from CommonJS

:::danger

You absolutely cannot `require` **bud.js** core. No CommonJS exports are offered.

:::

Importing ESM from CommonJS is a little less straight forward than the other way around. This is one of the reasons we recommend converting your config to `.mjs`.

The easiest way is to use a dynamic `import` statement. The biggest difference is that a dynamic import is asynchronous, whereas require is sync.

```js title="bud.config.cjs"
module.exports = async bud => {
  await import('browsersync-webpack-plugin')
}
```

In these cases you may find that the code returned from a dynamic `import` is set inside of a property called `default`.

### Using the `bud.module` helper utility

If you wish you may use `bud.module.import` instead of `import` (which will automatically return the value of `default`, if it is set):

```js title="bud.config.cjs"
module.exports = async bud => {
  await bud.module.import('browsersync-webpack-plugin')
}
```

The `node:module` interface provides a function `createRequire` that will let you directly require `CommonJS` code like you may be used to.
[See the nodejs module docs on `createRequire`](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#modulecreaterequirefilename).

**bud.js** has an instance of the `Require` function available at `bud.module.require` (it's context is the directory containing the project `package.json`):

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
export default async bud => {
  bud.module.require('browser-sync-webpack-plugin')

  // require.resolve works too
  bud.module.require.resolve('browser-sync-webpack-plugin')
}
```

If you just want the path to a module and aren't sure if it is CommonJS or ESM, you may use `bud.module.resolve`:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
export default async bud => {
  await bud.module.resolve('browser-sync-webpack-plugin')
}
```

This functionality is provided using the [`import-meta-resolve`](https://github.com/wooorm/import-meta-resolve) package. In the future we'll use the
`import.meta.resolve` API directly but right now it is labeled as `experimental` and requires a flag.

## Additional details

### Features

- New utility package: `@roots/wordpress-hmr`. Greatly simplifies block editor development for WordPress friends. I'm not sure where this fits into the docs yet, but [there is usage information available on this page](/packages/wordpress-hmr) for now.
- You can now use remote modules as if they were local. Check [the documentation on remote sources](/guides/general-use/remote-sources) for more information. This works, but it should be considered experimental. Let us know how it goes.
- You can now transpile to `esm`. This feature is not yet documented and should be considered experimental. You can try it out with `bud.esm.enable()`, but roots/sage users in particular should be aware that this will
  require additional setup. Acorn support for this feature is being worked out.
- Critical CSS extension got an update [and better documentation to go along with it](/extensions/bud-criticalcss).

### Fixes

- The error overlay got a little janked in 5.8. It's fixed now.

### Notes

- All extensions now provide a predictable export of `./extension` (eg: `@roots/bud-react/extension`).
- All `stylelint` and `eslint` presets are exported with the `.cjs` extension. If your eslint or stylelint config is already using the preset without an extension (as documented) you don't have to do anything. If you are specifying `.js` you will need to update it.
- The `lib` and `types` directories for all packages have been merged.
- All published code targets `es2021`. Update to node 16 if you are running an outdated version of node.
- `@roots/bud-support` is deprecated
- `@roots/bud-library` is deprecated (the default caching configuration is now better than this extension)
