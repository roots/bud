Notifications (macos), speed improvements, easier webpack customizations.

<!--truncate-->

## Performance

bud is now about 30% faster üéâ.

There is a new CLI flag `--flush` which will force a full recompilation if you feel like something is goofy. It's also recommended to run `bud clean` after installing an update.

## Notifier

MacOS notification center notices are fixed. If you don't want them run the cli command with the `--no-notify` flag.

## **bud.path** and **bud.setPath**

TLDR: Way less clunky to work with.

- `bud.path()` can be called with no parameters will now resolve to the project root.

- `bud.path('relative/path')` now returns an absolute path from a project relative one.

- `bud.path('/absolute/path')` is recognized as an absolute path and will not be interpolated.

- There are several reserved strings referencing key directories: `@src`, `@dist`, `@storage`, `@modules`. The `@` prefix is now being used to make it clearer that this is not a normal path.

- You can use `bud.setPath` to define additional directory aliases:

```ts
bud.setPath({'@config': 'app/config/directory'})

bud.path('@config/config-file.json')
// => [root]/app/config/directory/config-file.json
```

- This only applies to the _first segment_ and only when the _@_ symbol is prefixed. `app/@alias/example` will not work.

- This does not automatically make webpack aliases from a path. To use the same convention in your client scripts you still need to use `bud.alias`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Upgrade guide

- Any calls which referenced `'project'` as the first parameter should have that parameter removed. Examples:

  - `bud.path('project')` becomes `bud.path()`.
  - `bud.path('project', 'directory')` becomes `bud.path('directory')`.

- Any calls which used `src`, `dist`, `storage` or `modules` as the first parameter should be updated to use the `@` prefix. Examples:

  - `bud.path('src', 'some-file.js')` becomes `bud.path('@src', 'some-file.js')`.
  - Or, just `bud.path('@src/some-file.js')`.

- Any calls to `bud.setPath` which referenced those magic strings also needs to be updated. Example:
  - `bud.setPath('src', 'js')` becomes `bud.setPath('@src', 'js')`

## Defining modules is a lot easier

Want to add support to bud for some arcane syntax? Great news, the API for `loaders`, `items` and `rules` just got a nice upgrade.

Here's typescript.

```ts
app.build
  .setLoader('ts', 'ts-loader')
  .setItem('ts', {loader: 'ts', options: {}})
  .setRule('ts', {test: /\.tsx?/, use: [`babel`, `ts`]})
```

If you just want to modify an existing rule, there is lots for you in this update:

```ts
app.bulid.rule.ts.setUse([`babel`, `ts`])
app.build.loaders.ts.setSrc(`alternate-ts-loader`)
app.build.items.ts.setOptions({...options})
```

Extension authors should take advantage of how all properties for loader, item, and rule definitions can be expressed with a callback. This means if someone changes their source path later your rule will still be pointed in the right direction.
