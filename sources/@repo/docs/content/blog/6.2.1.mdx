## @roots/browserslist-config

Build tooling flagged that `@wordpress/browserslist-config` was licensed in a way that is not compatible with bud's overall licensing ideals.

Accordingly, we are now publishing our own browserslist config: `@roots/browserslist-config`. It provides a choice of three configurations. Select whichever is the best fit for your project and audience:

| Export                             | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @roots/browserslist-config         | >1%. Similar to @wordpress/browserslist-config                                         |
| @roots/browserslist-config/current | >.5%. Similar to @facebook/docusaurus' default                                         |
| @roots/browserslist-config/broad   | Targets the last 3 versions of major browsers. Similar to @shopify/browserslist-config |

All configurations target the most recent version of `firefox`, `chrome` and `safari` when the NODE_ENV is `development`.

## Upgrading to bud.js 6.2.1

If you are using `@wordpress/browserslist-config` in your project (check the `browserslist` field of `package.json` if you aren't sure) you will need to either:

- Update the `browserslist` field with a config from the table above.
- Install `@wordpress/browserslist-config` as a project dependency.

`@wordpress/browserslist-config` is no longer a dependency of bud.js, so you must do one of those two things or else you will experience build errors.
