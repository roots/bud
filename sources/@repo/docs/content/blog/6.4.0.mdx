## bud.assets

You can now specify copy options to apply to all copy patterns as a second parameter.

In this example we'll redefine the `context` for each item:

```ts
bud.assets(
  [
    {from: 'images', to: 'images'},
    {from: 'fonts', to: 'fonts'},
  ],
  {context: app.path('@assets')},
)
```

This is the same as:

```ts
bud.assets([
  {
    from: 'images',
    to: 'images',
    context: app.path('@assets'),
  },
  {
    from: 'fonts',
    to: 'fonts',
    context: app.path(`assets`),
  },
])
```

This also works with `string` or `[from, to]` tuples, as well.

## Client

### hot reload middleware

Internally, bud.js has fully replaced `webpack-hot-middleware` and its associated client scripts.

What you can expect:

- If you have an error in your code that fully breaks hot module reloading the client
  will automatically perform a full page reload.
- You should have far fewer duplicate log messages about module updates.

### proxy url replacement

If you are using [bud.proxy](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.proxy) you don't need to do anything. But, if you wanted to use this script directly it is now a lot more flexible.

There are two ways to utilize it:

#### 1. add to your entry imports array

`@roots/bud-client/lib/proxy-client-interceptor.js` accepts URL parameters for `search` and `replace` strings.

```ts
bud.entry({
  app: [
    // ... app scripts and styles
    `@roots/bud-client/lib/proxy-client-interceptor.js?search=http://example.com&replace=/`,
  ],
})
```

#### 2. import it in a client script

`@roots/bud-client/lib/intercept.js` can be imported directly and called from application code.

```js
import intercept from '@roots/bud-client/lib/intercept.js'

intercept('http://example.com', '/')
```

## Hooks

### bud.hooks.fromMap

`bud.hooks.fromMap` can be used to set multiple hooks in one call.

```ts
bud.hooks.fromMap({
  'build.node': false,
  'build.resolve.extensions': ext => ext.add('.mjml'),
})
```

### bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap

`bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap` can be used in the same way to set hooks with async callbacks.

```ts
bud.hooks.fromAsyncMap({
  'build.plugins': async () => await app.extensions.make(),
  'build.resolve.modules': async () => [
    app.hooks.filter(`location.@src`),
    app.hooks.filter(`location.@modules`),
  ],
})
```

Speaking generally, if you want to learn more about all of the available hooks you might be interesting in exploring more with the new [`bud view` command](#bud-view)

## Services

Services have access to some new methods that are called when the associated lifecycle event takes place.

In the order they are called:

| method name     | associated lifecycle event |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| `configAfter`   | `config.after`             |
| `compileBefore` | `compile.before`           |
| `buildBefore`   | `build.before`             |
| `buildAfter`    | `build.after`              |
| `compileAfter`  | `compile.after`            |

## Extensions

Extensions have access to some new methods that are called when the associated lifecycle event takes place.

In the order they are called:

| method name   | associated lifecycle event |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `configAfter` | `config.after`             |
| `buildBefore` | `build.before`             |
| `buildAfter`  | `build.after`              |

## CLI

### Enhanced build summary

Here's what you can expect:

```sh
◉  @tests/project ./dist [6c3fa82de0a7a70e5e45]
│
├─ entrypoints
│ ├─ app
│ │ └─ js/app.js           28.34 kB
│ ├─ app2
│ │ └─ js/app2.js          26.73 kB
│ └─ dev-client
│   └─ js/dev-client.js    84.61 kB
│
├─ assets
│ ├─ images/image.jpeg          761.41 kB
│ ├─ images/nested/image.jpeg   761.41 kB

… watching project sources
```

Some of the changes you may notice:

- Displays information for multiple compilations.
- Labeled (can be useful if running builds in parallel with yarn/npm workspaces).
  - tip: set your compilation label using the `name` field of `package.json`
- Indicates the directory being emitted to (also handy for identification purposes).
- Includes the oft-requested "external IP" for use over LAN.
- Visually grouped by entrypoint
- Improved display of compiler error messages
- Improved display of compiler warning messages

### bud repl

Start a repl to play around with bud: `$ bud repl`

| option        | description       | default |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| `--indent,-i` | indentation level | `1`     |
| `--depth,-d`  | recursion depth   | `2`     |

Some example queries you may wish to try:

`$ bud.hooks.syncStore`

`$ bud.extensions.get('webpack:define-plugin')`

`$ bud.make('test').then(bud => bud.get('test').label)`

`$ bud.extensions.make()`

`$ bud.hooks.filter('build.optimization')`

### bud view

Explore the bud object with `$ yarn bud view`. You can use dot notation to dive through properties.

| option        | description       | default |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| `--indent,-i` | indentation level | `2`     |
| `--color,-c`  | color             | `true`  |

Interesting examples:

See what functions were called: `$ yarn bud view api.trace`

View the generated config: `$ yarn bud view build.config`

You can go as deep as you need but if you are accessing an array by index you'll probably need to escape the brackets with quotes:

`$ yarn bud view 'build.config.module.rules[1].oneOf[0]'`

### bud webpack

This is a passthrough command for the webpack cli. Get webpack usage help `$ yarn bud webpack -- --help`

To run a build with webpack you'd probably want to create a new file named `webpack.config.js` in your project and do something like this:

```ts
// webpack.config.mjs

import {get} from '@roots/bud/factory'

export default async () => {
  const bud = await get()
  return await bud.build.make()
}
```

Run it with `$ yarn bud webpack`.

### Flags

`--basedir`

Set the application base directory. Default: `process.cwd()`

`--browser`

Now accepts an (optional) string to open the project in a specific browser. The exact string is system dependent. [Check the sindresorhus/open docs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open)

`--dry`

Will run bud.js all the way up until it's time to actually instantiate the compiler or the dev server, and then it bails.

`-v,-vv,-vvv,-vvvv`

Set logging level.

| Flag    | Level          |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `-v`    | error          |
| `-vv`   | warning        |
| `-vvv`  | log            |
| `-vvvv` | info (verbose) |

default: `-vv`.

`--debug`

Emit artifacts to storage directory for debugging bud.js context or the emitted webpack configuration. In earlier versions of bud.js a snapshot of the finalized webpack configuration and a snapshot of bud.js state was always saved to storage prior to compilation. If your project is working correctly this is just needless fs overhead.

default: `false`

`--reload`

allow bud.js to hard reload the browser window when an error is encountered that breaks hot module reloading.

default: `true`

### Extensions can register commands

Extensions can now register commands.

So far only one additional command has been added in this manner: `yarn bud ts check` can be used when `@roots/bud-typescript` is installed.

## ✨ Improve: builds now labeled by package.json `name` field

In earlier versions of bud.js the `bud.label` property was always set to `bud` (for the parent compiler). Now, it will be set to the `name` field
of your project (as set in `package.json`).

In addition to the clear output summary labeling (see above), you should also find that logs are better labeled now:

```
[bud@6.4.0] [my-project] › importing @roots/bud-terser/css-minimizer
```

If you're looking through `.budfiles` you'll see that build artifacts are broken down by compiler label as well:

```
❯ tree .budfiles
.budfiles
└── my-project
     └── cache
          └── development
```
