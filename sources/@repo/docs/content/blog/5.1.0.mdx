Bud v5.1.0 is a minor release. It includes a couple anticipated features and bug fixes.

<!--truncate-->

There are many fixes and core improvements based on feedback from the v5.0.0 release. Thanks to everyone who filed issues. There are a couple minor breaking changes.

Adds support for webp ðŸŽ‰

We now have an automated release process and will be publishing updates much faster. Thanks for your patience! It took a lot of work to get to this place and we think it's going to prove to be worth it for our project and yours.

## Known issues

If you use npm to install bud, you may need to remove dependencies that are shared with bud extensions in order to install the update.

After installation, run `npx bud install` followed by `npm install` to resolve everything.

In the near future bud will relax semver requirements to address this annoyance.

## Breaking

There are relatively minor breaking changes for users of **@roots/bud-imagemin** and **@roots/sage** and one breaking change in core.

### bud.assets requires absolute paths

If you wanted, consider the `bud.path` helper to easily get an absolute path.

Resolve relative to the the src directory:

```js
bud.assets([bud.path('src', 'images/**/*.{jpg,png}')])
```

Resolve from the root of your project:

```js
bud.assets([bud.path('project', 'src/images/**/*.{jpg,png}')])
```

In the future, hopefully this will not be a requirement. But for now it is.

### @roots/bud-imagemin

We have switched to [@squoosh/lib](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh) and there is a new configuration API. It should be an easy change. [See @roots/bud-imagemin docs](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-imagemin).

### @roots/sage

Users need to opt-in to specific features by installing:

- @roots/bud-stylelint
- @roots/bud-eslint
- @roots/bud-tailwindcss
- @roots/bud-prettier
