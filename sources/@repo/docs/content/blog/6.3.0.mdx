## @roots/browserslist-config

Build tooling flagged that `@wordpress/browserslist-config` was licensed in a way that is not compatible with bud's overall licensing ideals.

Accordingly, we are now publishing a roots standard browserslist config: `@roots/browserslist-config`. It provides a choice of three configurations. Select whichever is the best fit for your project and audience:

| Export                             | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @roots/browserslist-config         | >1%. Similar to @wordpress/browserslist-config                                         |
| @roots/browserslist-config/current | >.5%. Similar to @facebook/docusaurus' default                                         |
| @roots/browserslist-config/broad   | Targets the last 3 versions of major browsers. Similar to @shopify/browserslist-config |

All configurations target the most recent version of `firefox`, `chrome` and `safari` when the NODE_ENV is `development`.

## Fix: @roots/bud-vue

A small configuration issues in the @roots/bud-vue extension has been fixed. Returns `@roots/bud-vue` to the zero-config ideal.

## Improvement: env expansion now only applied to project `.env` values

**bud.js** still sources envvars from process and its path, but will no longer attempt to expand values outside of bud root.

This could cause issues if `${` and other such character strings were used in another context.

## Improvement: multi-compiler root directory

You can now pass an overrides object to `bud.make`'s first parameter, which will be merged with the default object. This is particularly useful for setting a root directory, but it takes any options from `bud.factory` (if you want to override extensions, for instance).

This documentation has a ways to go, but the [bud.make](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.make) docs have been updated with more information and an example of this new fn signature.

## Documentation: Improved `@roots/bud-postcss` docs

Lots more information has been added to the [@roots/bud-postcss documentation](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-postcss).

## Upgrading to bud.js 6.3.0

If you are using `@wordpress/browserslist-config` in your project (check the `browserslist` field of `package.json` if you aren't sure) you will need to either:

- Update the `browserslist` field with a config from the table above.
- Install `@wordpress/browserslist-config` as a project dependency.

`@wordpress/browserslist-config` is no longer a dependency of bud.js, so you must do one of those two things or else you will experience build errors.
