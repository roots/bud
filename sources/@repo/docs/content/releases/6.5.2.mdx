Bug fix for multi-instance builds.

<!--truncate-->

## Fix: Client script injection TypeError when no entrypoints are specified

Specifying an entrypoint is optional and, accordingly, its value may very well return `undefined`.
This possibility was not handled correctly by `@roots/bud-server/inject` for multi-instance configurations, and would throw a `TypeError` if a child didn't explicitly set an instance. This is now fixed.

## Fix: Certain conditionally applied extensions enabled/disabled globally in multi-instance

In multi-instance configurations the last call to `Extension.enable()` or `Extension.disable()` would be applied to all instances. This has been fixed.
