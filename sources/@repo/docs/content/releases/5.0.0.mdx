import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

Featuring multi-compiler, automatic extension detection, and more.

<!--truncate-->

Bud v5 comes with a lot of changes. Please [review the diff to see what's changed](https://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0).

**The most important change**
You no longer need to explicitly require an extension in your configuration file or call `bud.use` to load it. Bud will automatically load the extensions you have installed. This feature can be circumvented with the **--no-inject** flag but this is not as well tested as the default behavior.

### multi-compiler

`bud.make` will create a new instance of Bud.

```ts
interface make {
  (name: string, tap?: (child: Bud) => any): Promise<Bud>
}
```

The easiest and cleanest way to use this feature is with a callback. `bud.make` ultimately returns the parent compiler instance for fluent chaining.

```ts title='bud.config.ts'
export default async (bud: Bud) => {
  bud
    .make('my-wordpress-theme', async (theme: Bud) => {
      // theme is a fresh copy of Bud
    })
    .make('my-wordpress-plugin', async (plugin: Bud) => {
      // plugin is a fresh copy of Bud
    })
  // you can call bud.make as many times as you please
}
```

You can retrieve a compiler you have already made with `bud.get`.

```ts
bud.get('child')
  .entry(...) // configuring the child
```

Compile all the things:

### You can now use Webpack plugins directly

Previously, a `name` property was required for bud extensions. This is still required for extension authors,
since it is nice for config maintainers and other extension authors to have a way to reference your
extension should they want to change the way it works.

However, this is unnecessary for users who simply wish to use some Webpack plugin in their project.

Previously, a small amount of boilerplate was required to wrap a plugin:

```ts
bud.use({
  name: 'my-webpack-plugin',
  make: new MyWebpackPlugin(),
})
```

But, now you can just use a plugin. A name will be automatically generated.

```ts
bud.use(new MyWebpackPlugin())
```

A side effect of this is that extension authors can now make a single package that works both with vanilla webpack and bud:

```ts
const extension = {
  name: 'my-bud-extension',
  apply: compiler => {
    // webpack apply
  },
  when: bud => bud.isProduction,
  // register, boot, api, or any other extension prop
}
```

Note that `extension.apply` overrules `extension.make`. If you include both it won't throw an error or anything, but `extension.make` won't produce a webpack plugin in the final config (unless you call it from `apply` and use webpack apis to add the plugin manually).
