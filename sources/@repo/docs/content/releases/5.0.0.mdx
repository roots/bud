Bud v5 comes with a lot of changes. Please [review the diff to see what's changed](https://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v4.6.0...v5.0.0")

** The most important change**

You no longer need to explicitly require an extension in your
configuration file or call `bud.use` to load it. Bud will
automatically load the extensions you have installed. This
feature can be circumvented with the **--no-inject** flag but
this is not as well tested as the default behavior.

## Breaking

- `@roots/bud-cli` has been deprecated. CLI functionality is packaged with `@roots/bud`.
- `bud.use` method is now asynchronous.
- `bud.build.make` method is now asynchronous.
- Hook key `build` now refers to an asynchronous filter.
- Hook key `build.plugins` now refers to an asynchronous filter.
- `bud.extensions.enqueue` can be used to enqueue a plugin and returns Bud instance for chaining.
- `@roots/bud` no longer exports `Framework`. Use `Bud` or import `Framework` from `@roots/bud-framework` instead.

## Added

- Yaml, json5 and TypeScript config file support.

- Multi-compiler support:

  - `bud.make` will create a new Bud instance for you to configure.
  - `bud.get` will retrieve a previously made child instance for further configuration.
  - `bud.set` allows setting a Bud instance as a `bud.children` entry.
  - `bud.root` always returns the parent compiler. If called from the parent it will return itself.
  - `bud.isRoot` will be true in the parent context.
  - `bud.hasChildren` will be true in the parent context if there are child Bud instances.

- Several new hooks:

  - `event.build.make.before` is called just before the webpack config is created (async).
  - `event.build.make.after` is called just after the webpack config is created (async).
  - `event.compiler.before` is called just before the final config is passed to webpack.
  - `event.compiler.after` is called just after the final config is passed to webpack.

- New CLI commands:

  - **bud clean** - removes dist and cache files
  - **bud doctor** - check for missing peer dependencies and configuration errors
  - **bud install** - automatically install/update required dependencies
  - **bud serve** - start the development server and initiate hot module reloading

- New `bud build` flags:

  - **--target** Target a specific Bud instance to be built in isolation. Can be passed multiple times to target more than one compiler.
  - **--[no]-cache** Toggle filesystem caching. [default: `true`]
  - **--cache.type** Set the cache type. Can be `filesystem` or `memory`. [default: `filesystem`]
  - **--location.[src|dist|project|storage]** Set a project disk location
  - **--[no]-log** - Toggle logging [default: `true`]
  - **--[no]-log.level** - Set logging level (`v`, `vv`, `vvv`, `vvvv`) [default: `vvv`]
  - **--[no]-log.papertrail** - Allow logger lines to overwrite the previous line from the same scope [default: `--no-log.papertrail`]
  - **--log-secret** - Suppress a string from logger output (can use multiple times) [default: `--log-secret {cwd}`]
  - **--[no]-dashboard** - Toggle the bud dashboard [default: `--dashboard`]
  - ...many more! add **--help** after any command to see what options are available.

- [example project](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/examples/webpack-plugin) demonstrating how to use off-the-shelf webpack plugins with `bud.use`

## Improved

- Greatly improved performance. The entire Bud lifecycle is asynchronous.
- Extensions that follow the `bud-*` naming convention are now automatically registered and booted.
- Peer dependency requirements are now checked. Missing dependencies will not throw an error but will be logged.
- **bud.use** now supports using Webpack plugins directly.
- Informative logging.
- The CLI and dashboard have a fresh coat of paint.
- New notification center integration (MacOS only)

## Internal

- `@roots/bud-typings` has been deprecated.
- Added [`@roots/yarn-plugin-repo`](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/.yarn/local) to provide utilities in the `yarn repo` namespace.
