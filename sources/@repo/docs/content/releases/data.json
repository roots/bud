    "body": "## Fixed: module reload problems\r\n\r\nThe origin of this problem stems from WordPress not enqueuing assets that depend on `wp-react-refresh-runtime` if the WordPress config variable `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is not `true`. bud.js will now check the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` env variable, and if `true` will use `wp-react-refresh-runtime`. Otherwise, that runtime will be included in the bundle and the script dependency will be left undeclared. In lieu of an environment variable you can call `bud.wp.setScriptDebug(true)` in your bud.js configuration.\r\n\r\nIf you opt in (either by calling the config function or setting the environment variable) you must make sure it is set in your WordPress config. If you do nothing, you'll probably be fine, but we recommend either setting the environment variable or calling the new config function if you experience conflicts between the WordPress core dev runtime and bud.js dev runtime.\r\n\r\n## Feature: Support for mapping tailwindcss `theme.spacing` values to theme.json\r\n\r\nCall `bud.wp.json.useTailwindSpacing()` to source spacing values from your tailwind config.\r\n\r\n## Fix: Node 16 compatibility\r\n\r\nDowngraded globby from v14 to v13 so as to maintain compatibility with Node 16. We will be moving to Node 20 with the next major release of bud.js but we want to maintain compatibility with Node 16 for all bud.js 6.x.x releases. You should see major benefits in performance and reliability using Node 20 so we definitely recommend upgrading as soon as possible, if you can.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* 📦 deps(patch): downgrade globby to v13 by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2532\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): WordPress module reload failures by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2530\r\n* 📦 deps(patch): upgrade dependencies by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2534\r\n* ✨ feat(patch): add theme.spacing support to theme.json generator by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2528\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v6.19.1...v6.20.0",

If you are using the `build.module.rules` hook (or any of its inner hooks, like `build.module.rules.oneOf`), you may need to update code if you are relying on the rules being ordered in a particular way.  Thanks to @rkaalma for the report.\r\n\r\nThere also corrects a sneaky issue where expanded environment variables were not always being overridden as designed.\r\n\r\nLastly, there have been improvements made to the handling of webpack plugin instances used directly with `bud.extensions.add` or [bud.use](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.use). Related tests have been improved along with the [example config](https://github.com/roots/bud/blob/main/examples/webpack-plugin/bud.config.ts).

It can be disabled by [setting an environment variable](https://bud.js.org/learn/config/files/env#configurable-environment-variables) (`BUD_BROWSERSLIST_UPDATE=false`), or with the `--no-browserslist-update` flag.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- Fixes an issue where sometimes a stale error notification would persist in the browser even after it was fixed in source.\r\n- Fixes an issue where sometimes installations could hang when using Yarn v3+.\r\n\r\n## New\r\n\r\n- **[bud.addConfig](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.addConfig)**: config function which accepts  a path to another config file to run. \r\n- **[bud.lazy](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.lazy)**: config function to configure lazy compilation settings.\r\n\r\n## Improved\r\n\r\n- [bud.devtool](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.devtool), [bud.hash](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.hash) [bud.minimize](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.minimize), [bud.persist](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.persist), and [bud.runtime](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.runtime) now accept `Bud` as an argument so they can be more readily combined with functions like [bud.when](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.when) (e.g. `bud.when(bud.isDevelopment, bud.devtool)`).\r\n- [bud.hash](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.hash): Now accepts the hash generation function as a string, if you want to customize it. \r\n- **`--runtime` flag**: now accepts a string argument (e.g. `--runtime=single`, `--runtime=multiple`). It can still be used as a boolean flag: (e.g. `--runtime`, `--no-runtime`). \r\n- **[bud build development](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/build/development)**: Help menu with keyboard shortcuts (toggle with `h`).\r\n- YML configs now support dot notation in config keys. See [updated documentation](https://bud.js.org/learn/config/files/bud.config#configuring-budjs-with-yml).\r\n- **[bud repl](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/repl)**: This command is now more responsive to terminal window sizing (it was previously capped at 10 rows). \r\n- **[bud clean](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/clean)**: This command now only lists directories which it actually removed.\r\n- All extensions now have a `done` method which returns the bud instance, for better chaining.\r\n- General improvements to logging (`--log`).\r\n- General improvements to exception handling.\r\n- Code minimizers (terser, etc.) are lazy loaded only when they are used, which is a performance gain.\r\n- html-webpack-plugin is lazy loaded only when it is being used, which is a performance gain.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* ✨ improve(minor): improve extension interoperability by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2474\r\n* 🧪 test(none): improve test cache management by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2477\r\n* ✨ improve(patch): cli and logging by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2481\r\n* ✨ improve(minor): bud dev dx by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2482\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): fix --silent and --no-dashboard output by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2485\r\n* ✨ feat(minor): lazy compilation facade and flag by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2486\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): Add `roots` to eslint globals by @joshuafredrickson in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2479\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): fix browserslist db errors by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2490\r\n* ✨ improve(patch): Improve error handling and logging by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2494\r\n* 🩹 fix (patch): doctor subcommand by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2498\r\n* ✨feat(minor): browserslist auto upgrade by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2493\r\n* ✨ improve(patch): improve browserslist upgrade behavior by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2499\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): fix cache dir by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2500\r\n* ✨ improve(patch): cli arguments by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2501\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): fix macos notifier default by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2502\r\n* ✨ feat(minor): add acorn opt-out by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2503\r\n* ✨ improve(patch): improve facades by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2504\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v6.17.0...v6.18.0",

    "body": "## ⚠️ Potentially breaking change\r\n\r\n@roots/sage: previously `bud.splitChunks('single')` was called for production builds. This is no longer the default for two reasons:\r\n  1. If you have an editor entrypoint and an app entrypoint (common), it is possible that editor dependencies could be extracted into the common chunk. This can lead to Acorn enqueuing those dependencies for both `app` and `editor`, even if they were only used in one (since the shared vendor module contains references to the dependencies). \r\n  2. This is very easy to address as part of your application and that approach is preferred. Especially now that top-level async/await is available for bud.js application modules. \r\n  3. If you really want a vendors chunk, just call `bud.splitChunks()` or pass the `--splitChunks` flag.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* 📕 docs: improve docs by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2368\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): register command type error after extension uninstall by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2372\r\n* 👍🏼 improve(minor): internals & tests by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2373\r\n* 🧹 chore(none): cleanup by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2376\r\n* 📦 deps(patch): bump vitest from 0.32.2 to 0.33.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2375\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump @babel/core from 7.22.5 to 7.22.9 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2374\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump ts-loader from 9.4.3 to 9.4.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2356\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump @babel/runtime from 7.22.5 to 7.22.6 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2355\r\n* 📦 deps(minor): upgrade by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2377\r\n* 🩹 fix(none): readme generation by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2378\r\n* 🩹 fix(none): nightly release by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2383\r\n* 🩹 fix: parallelism by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2386\r\n* 👍🏼 improve: build performance by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2387\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump word-wrap from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2384\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump esbuild from 0.18.13 to 0.18.14 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2379\r\n* 👍🏼 improve: error handling by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2388\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump esbuild-wasm from 0.18.13 to 0.18.14 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2380\r\n* ✨ feat(minor): configurable wordpress externals by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2389\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): `--editor` warning when `--editor` not used by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2390\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): multi-compiler uncaught errors in dev by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2392\r\n* 📕 docs: fix @roots/bud-sass installation docs by @xeader in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2391\r\n* ✨ improve: stricter typings by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2393\r\n* 🗂️ types(patch): strict typings by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2394\r\n* ✨ improve: typings & tests by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2395\r\n* 🗂️ types(none): improve typechecking by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2396\r\n* 📕 docs(none): wordpress enqueues by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2397\r\n* 🩹 fix(patch): fix casing in dashboard of Dev by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2398\r\n* ✨ improve(minor): no split chunks (@roots/sage) by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2399\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @xeader made their first contribution in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2391\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v6.14.3...v6.15.0",

The `module` property for each value in `bud.context.files` is now an async function that returns the module. This is an undocumented internal, but some people might be using it.\r\n\r\n## Key changes\r\n\r\n- ✨ feature: top level await (enabled for ESM projects only)\r\n- ✨ feature: creates aliases from [`imports` field of package.json](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports)\r\n- ✨ feature: dynamic modules now compiled lazily in development\r\n- 🏎️ performance: multi-config builds are now built in parallel\r\n- ✨ improve: config files now lazy loaded\r\n- ✨ improve(`@roots/wordpress-theme-json-webpack-plugin`): `theme.json` included in compilation module graph\r\n- ✨ improve(`@roots/bud-tailwindcss-theme-json`): Edits to `tailwind.config.js` now result in rebuild of `theme.json`\r\n- ✨ improve(`@roots/entrypoints-webpack-plugin`): `entrypoints.json` included in compilation module graph\r\n- ✨ improve(`@roots/bud-dashboard`): improved UI\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--entrypoints.html` (same as calling `bud.entrypoints.set('emitHtml', true)`; emits partials containing `<script>` and `<style>` tags)\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--dashboard` (use dashboard stats vs. simple stats output)\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--dashboard.assets` (show/hide presentation of assets)\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--dashboard.compact` (truncated build summary)\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--dashboard.entrypoints` (show/hide presentation of entrypoints)\r\n- ✨ add flag: `--dashboard.server` (show/hide server info)\r\n- ✨ feature: for multi-compiler builds `1`-`9` will show stats isolated by compiler. `0` shows all compilers.\r\n- ✨ feature: `d` when viewing the dashboard will show detailed debug stats\r\n- ✨ feature: `c` when viewing the dashboard will present output with compact formatting\r\n- 🩹 fix: issues with bud.js cli error output\r\n- 🩹 fix: issues with bud.js internal module resolution cache\r\n- 📦 pkg(`@roots/wordpress-transforms`): small utility for translating `@wordpress/*` signifiers to `wp-*` enqueue handles and `wp.*` window references\r\n- 🗂️ typings(`@roots/bud-framework`): flatten organization of typings\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n### bud.js module resolution cache is now self-healing\r\n\r\nThe bud.js module resolution cache is now self-healing. If a build dependency was previously available at some path but is now unresolvable its entry will be updated while still preserving the rest of the cache. There should now be limited reason to use `--force` to manually flush the cache; it will probably only serve to make your next build slower.\r\n\r\n### `--no-clean` will be a future default\r\n\r\nYou can get a surprising performance boost by using the `--no-clean` flag (some test projects are >15% faster). Why delete and rewrite modules which have not been modified? This will be default in the next major release of bud.js.\r\n\r\n### You might not want to make a vendor chunk\r\n\r\nIf you are doing a lot of code splitting with imports, try disabling chunking and see if it improves initial page load (`bud.splitChunks(false)` or `--no-splitChunks`). The extra runtime code might not be worth it if you are already importing modules conditionally.\r\n\r\n### `--ci` will soon mean more than \"run this without fanciness\"\r\n\r\nIf you are using `--ci` solely to not display stats consider switching to `--no-dashboard`. There may be changes in the future to the behavior of this flag which are focused on CI environments specifically.\r\n\r\n### bud.js instance is now importable\r\n\r\nThe bud.js instance is now available as a named import from @roots/bud (`import {bud} from '@roots/bud'`). This allows for a bunch of stuff you couldn't do before. Like, as an example, configuring bud.js without an exported callback:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport {bud} from '@roots/bud'\r\n\r\nbud.entry('app', ['app.js', 'app.css'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also import the instance into other config modules or custom scripts. Not all tools will play nicely. Tailwindcss, for example, will try to bundle bud.js along with your tailwind config using jiti. It won't succeed (jiti can't handle [import.meta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta)).\r\n\r\n## Full Changelog\r\n\r\n* 🩹 fix: bud upgrade by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2323\r\n* ✨ improve: bud error handling by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2326\r\n* ✨ improve: error handling by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2327\r\n* ✨ improve: dashboard by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2329\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump @types/eslint from 8.40.1 to 8.40.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2318\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump @swc/plugin-emotion from 2.5.51 to 2.5.68 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2320\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump @swc/core from 1.3.42 to 1.3.66 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2333\r\n* 📦 deps(deps): bump semver from 7.5.1 to 7.5.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2337\r\n* 📦 deps(deps-dev): bump @aws-sdk/client-s3 from 3.348.0 to 3.357.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2334\r\n* ✨ improve: config module handling by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2336\r\n* 📦 deps: upgrade packages by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2342\r\n* 🧹 cleanup: streamline lifecycle/cli init by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2347\r\n* 🧪 test: cli flags by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2348\r\n* 📕 docs: update readme by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2354\r\n* 🩹 fix: config.after by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2359\r\n* 🧪 test: improve integration by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2361\r\n* 🗂️ typings: @roots/bud/instance by @kellymears in https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2360\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/roots/bud/compare/v6.13.1...v6.14.0",

For example, if you want to import a module from `./some-module.ts`, you would likely want to import it like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport someModule from './some-module.js'\r\n```\r\n\r\nbud.js works the same way now, in practice. Now, if you want to write your import statements in a way that is compliant with TSC, you can.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\n<summary>\n<strong><code>bud.setPath</code> now automatically sets aliased paths</strong>\n</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIf you set a path handle with `bud.setPath` it now sets up a path alias as well.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\n<summary>\n<strong>JSON schema available</strong>\n</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nJSON schema available at `https://bud.js.org/bud.package.json`. You can optionally add it to `package.json` for validation of `package.json` fields (including bud specific ones):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://bud.js.org/bud.package.json\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\n<summary>\n<strong>Improved extension options API</strong>\n</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nEvery registered extension option now has a dedicated getter and setter. The getter prefixes the option key with `get` and the setter prefixes it with `set`.\r\n\r\n| Option | Getter | Setter |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| bud.extension.optionName | bud.extension.getOptionName() | bud.extension.setOptionName(value) |\r\n\r\nLastly, know that the `setOptionName` always accepts a callback:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.extension.setOptionName(value => value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nLet's say `@roots/bud-eslint` has a new option defined (since it does):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlintDirtyModulesOnly: EslintPluginOptions['lintDirtyModulesOnly']\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously you could get this value like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbud.eslint.get(`lintDirtyModulesOnly`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat still works, but now you have some additional options:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/** Get the value via a property */\r\nbud.eslint.lintDirtyModulesOnly\r\n/** Get the value via a function */\r\nbud.eslint.getLintDirtyModulesOnly()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in addition to `bud.eslint.set`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.eslint.set(`lintDirtyModulesOnly`, true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now set it with a dedicated setter method:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.eslint.setLintDirtyModulesOnly(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll such setter methods accept a callback:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.eslint.setLintDirtyModulesOnly(value => !value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\n</details>\r\n\r\n## @roots/bud-postcss\r\n\r\n- The postcss configuration API has gotten a rework. \r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-postcss).\r\n\r\n## @roots/bud-eslint\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.eslint`\r\n- Configure eslint in your bud config\r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-eslint).\r\n\r\n## @roots/bud-sass\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.sass`\r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-sass).\r\n\r\n## @roots/bud-stylelint\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.stylelint`\r\n- Configure stylelint in your bud config\r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-stylelint).\r\n\r\n### @roots/bud-swc\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.swc`\r\n- Override base configuration for js and ts separately\r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-swc).\r\n\r\n### @roots/bud-tailwindcss\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.tailwind`\r\n- Supports configuring tailwindcss directly in bud config\r\n\r\nRefer to the [updated documentation for more information](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-tailwindcss).\r\n\r\n### @roots/bud-wordpress-theme-json\r\n\r\n- New options and methods exposed by `bud.wpjson`\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n- `experiments.backCompat` now set to `false`. bud doesn't need backwards compatibility with webpack 4 and the compatibility fixes come with performance penalties related to `Array` objects.\r\n- `snapshot.buildDependencies` uses a hash if `bud.env.get('CI')` is `true`; uses a timestamp otherwise.\r\n- `snapshot.module` uses a hash if `bud.env.get('CI')` is `true`; uses a timestamp otherwise.\r\n- `snapshot.resolve` uses a hash if `bud.env.get('CI')` is `true`; uses a timestamp otherwise.\r\n- `snapshot.resolveBuildDependencies` uses a hash if `bud.env.get('CI')` is `true`; uses a timestamp otherwise.\r\n- `resolveLoader.alias` defined for all registered loaders.\r\n- `resolve.unsafeCache` set to `undefined` (was `false`). default behavior is for `unsafeCache` to be used in development, and not used in production.\r\n- `profile` now set to `true` if `--debug` flag is `true`.\r\n- `performance` now set to `false` (was `{hints: false}`).\r\n- `externalsType` set to `undefined` (was `var`).\r\n- `bud.context.logger` is removed.\r\n- `APP_TITLE` fallback set for projects which use `bud.html`.\r\n- `NO_SCRIPT` fallback set for projects which use `bud.html`.\r\n- Typings for WordPress `theme.json` updated using current schema.\r\n- Build script now in place to help with future updates to WordPress `theme.json`.\r\n- Default css minimizer is now [lightningcss](https://lightningcss.dev) (css parser used by parcel).\r\n- If using `@roots/bud-swc` css minification is handled by swc.\r\n- If using `@roots/bud-esbuild` css minification is handled by esbuild.\r\n- New documentation for [bud.minify](https://bud.js.org/docs/minify).",

    "body": "## Fixes\r\n\r\n### Failure installing custom TypeScript version with yarn\r\n\r\nFixes an error encountered when trying to install a custom version of TypeScript while using `@roots/bud-typescript` with yarn classic. [See #2216](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/2216).\r\n\r\nThis issue is actually an upstream bug in yarn. But, our response sidesteps it and also improves compatibility with pnpm. \r\n\r\nThe short version: we don't need to declare `typescript` as a peer dependency because of changes to `bud.module` made in bud v6. It will always try to resolve from the project context before using the built-in as a fallback. \r\n\r\nSo, even without peer dependencies defined by the extension, the following call (when made from the `@roots/bud-typescript` context) will always try and resolve the module first from `node_modules/typescript`, and then `node_modules/@roots/bud-typescript/node_modules`. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.module.resolve(`typescript`, import.meta.url)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change that fixes #2216 has also been applied to `@roots/bud-eslint` and `@roots/bud-babel`. We'll apply it to other packages which use `peerDependencies` in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n### Include eslint and tailwind configs in build dependencies\r\n\r\n[#2233 Include tailwind & eslint configs in cached build dependencies](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2233) adds discovered `tailwind` and `eslint` configs to the map of files the compiler uses to validate the cache. Hopefully changes made to your tailwind config will now be more reliably reflected in your next build without having to use the `--force` flag. Additionally, only modules related to the changed config will be invalidated, which will be much faster than wiping everything.\r\n\r\n### Prevent invoking multiple `esbuild` and/or `esbuild-wasm` modules\r\n\r\nWhen transforming configuration modules authored in TypeScript bud.js will now prefer `esbuild` or `esbuild-wasm` as defined by `package.json`, if they are included.  The built-in `esbuild-wasm` included in `@roots/bud-support` is used as a fallback. This should be a minor improvement for users who are using `esbuild` in some other way as part of their build.\r\n\r\n### Vendor `bind` decorator from `helpful-decorators`.\r\n\r\n`helpful-decorators` is an awesome package but we are only using `bind` from it and it is used in a lot of places. This change eliminates the (modest) overhead associated with all the unused modules.",

    "body": "## 📦 tailwindcss 3.3.0 supported\r\n\r\nbud.js now supports the new configuration options from tailwindcss 3.3.0. tailwind configs can now be authored with typescript or esm.\r\n\r\n## 🧹 default storage location: .budfiles -> os cache dir\r\n\r\nLess junk in your project is always good, right? The new default `@storage` directory is now `[os-cache dir]/bud-nodejs/[hash of project path]`. \r\n\r\n**Breaking change**: If you are explicitly setting the `@storage` directory you need to do it using the `--storage` CLI flag or the `APP_STORAGE_PATH` .env variable. By the time config files have been processed most reads and writes to `@storage` will have already occurred, so `bud.setPath` won't be effective. There will be a warning logged to the console if you are doing this; the main adverse effect will be slower builds when bud.js can't find caches during bootstrapping.\r\n\r\n**Potentially breaking change**: If you are using remote modules (which lets you import modules from cdns like [skypack](https://skypack.dev) without installing locally) the `bud.lock` lockfile will now be written to the root of your project (unless you have configured it to be written somewhere else).\r\n\r\n## ✨ Config files can be written in TypeScript (without extensions)\r\n\r\nbud.js configuration files can now be authored in typescript without installing any additional extensions. if you were previously using the `ts-bud` binary you still can (it executes the bud.js runtime  with ts-node), but you can now just use the standard `bud` command (it is faster). `ts-bud` remains available in case you were doing some deeper integration with ts-node.\r\n\r\nThe parsing of TypeScript configs is handled with [esbuild-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-wasm). I have not been able to measure a meaningful difference in timings using this package instead of [esbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild) and the wasm binary doesn't need to be built so installs are a lot faster. However, if you want to use esbuild instead of esbuild-wasm you can install esbuild as a project dependency and it will be used instead. Again, I don't think it's worth the extra installation time. Especially since the results of config transforms are cached.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to eslint, tailwindcss, postcss and babel configs.\r\n\r\n## ✨ Config files can be stored in `./config` directory\r\n\r\nbud.js configuration files can now be stored in the `config` directory. This also applies to eslint, tailwindcss, postcss and babel configs.\r\n\r\n## ✨ @roots/bud-eslint: upgrade eslint-webpack-plugin to v4\r\n\r\neslint-webpack-plugin@4 removes need for eslint cache fix\r\n\r\nIf you were disabling the fix with `bud.eslint.cacheFix.enable(false)` before you will be prompted to remove that call, as it is now deprecated.\r\n\r\nSee [#2191](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2191)\r\n\r\n## 🏎️ performance: module resolution caching\r\n\r\nModule paths resolved by `bud.module` are cached to `[cachedir]/resolutions.yml`. This gives a nice performance boost since we can skip a lot of lookups: \r\n\r\nThe `resolve` and `import` methods used by `bud.module` treat built-in dependencies as fallbacks. So, if you aren't overriding any built-in dependencies and the cache is valid the net result is more than half as many calls to `importMetaResolve` and `import` statements.\r\n\r\n- sha1 hashes are calculated for files in root and `config/*` and an artifact is output to `[cachedir]/checksum.yml`.\r\n- Hash mismatches in config files or `package.json` will invalidate the `bud.module` resolver cache and the `compiler` cache. \r\n\r\n## 🏎️ performance: reuse context & bud instances \r\n\r\n`bud.context` is now re-used between bootstrap scripts and the cli application. \r\n\r\n## ✨ improve: unified error handling\r\n\r\nNow extending [modern-errors](https://github.com/ehmicky/modern-errors) for unified error handling.\r\n\r\n## 🩹 fix: no postinstall scripts in CI\r\n\r\nThere are some reliability issues with postinstall scripts (for @roots/bud-framework and @roots/browserslists-config) running in CI.\r\n\r\nThis update disables postinstall scripts when `process.env.CI` is set (default for gh actions).\r\n\r\nSee [#2169](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2169)\r\n\r\n## ✨ improve(@roots/eslint-config): remove react-in-jsx-scope \r\n\r\nThis rule is not really appropriate as a default for modern React.\r\n\r\nSee [#2154](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2154)\r\n\r\n## 👩‍🔬 experimental: pnpm support\r\n\r\nInstalls with `pnpm` should work now. They may break again in the future, but we're closer to being able to claim full compatibility. You must install with public hoisting:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npnpm install --public-hoist-pattern=*\r\n```\r\n\r\npnpm installs peers by default as of pnpm v8 🎉, so we suspect that compatibility will be a lot better once people upgrade.\r\n\r\n## 📦 upgrade ink to v4\r\n\r\nA ton of workarounds were required to make ink work prior to this upgrade. It's now compatible with react 18 and fully esm 🎉. \r\n\r\n## 📕 Documentation improvements\r\n\r\n- Thanks to @chrillep for improving the `@roots/bud-eslint` documentation example config\r\n- Adds documentation for `bud.config`\r\n- Improves documentation for `bud.define`\r\n- Adds pnpm installation instructions to getting started guide",

    "body": "If you have any trouble installing try the `--force` flag.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- There have been some fixes made to [bud.assets](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.assets) which make the function behave much more predictably. Still, I'm concerned there might be workarounds people are using which will no longer be working around. Check out the documentation and consider replacing complex [bud.assets](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.assets) calls with the new [bud.copyFile](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.copyFile) and [bud.copyDir](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.copyFile) functions.\r\n\r\n- If you are configuring bud.js with JSON or YML you will need to update any functions which accept a single argument which is an array. `bud.config.json` and `bud.config.yml` arguments are now expressed as an array, so there is no good way for the config parser to determine that you actually wanted to pass an array and not multiple params.\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  assets: \r\n  -  - 'image.jpeg'\r\n  +  - ['image.jpeg']\r\n  ```\r\n- If you have been using the new blade view directives in your Sage project you will need to update them. There is now a single directive to replace all previous directives: `@module`. So, `@js import '@scripts/confetti.js' @endjs` becomes `@module('js') import '@scripts/confetti.js' @endmodule`. This should support all module types now, generically. Built-in support for this feature is still in process for roots/acorn. An example `ModuleDirective` and `EndModuleDirective` class have been updated and included in `@roots/blade-loader/vendor`. \r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -@js\r\n  +@module('js')\r\n  console.log('hello')\r\n  -@endjs\r\n  +@endmodule\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nA bunch of extension functions are going to be removed at some point in the future (bud.js 7). Most of these are simple wrappers for the built-in extensions API. \r\n\r\nIf you are using a deprecated function you can expect IDE notifications (if you use an IDE that supports the `@deprecated` doctype), but you will also see warnings in the terminal with specific instructions for how to update the call.\r\n\r\nWe'll go slow when removing these functions; don't fret about it. This [github issue (#2079)](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/2079) is dedicated to tracking related function deprecations.\r\n\r\n## Improved WordPress editor support\r\n\r\nEasily add `blocks`, `plugins`, `filters`, `styles`, `variations` and `formats` in production and development with next to no boilerplate along with full hot module reloading (HMR) support.\r\n\r\n[See the updated documentation for specifics on implementing it in your WordPress project](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress/editor-integration). There is also [a new example in the examples directory](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/examples/wordpress-editor) to get a feel for how it comes together.\r\n\r\nThis feature is new so I suspect early adopters may bump into issues. But, we've been using the underlying library that powers this for many months now and it seems to work quite well in-house.\r\n\r\n## Improved yml and json config support\r\n\r\nSee [the updated documentation](https://bud.js.org/guides/general-use/alternative-config-syntax). Short version: anything you can do in a js file you can now do in a yml file.\r\n\r\n## New functions for copying files\r\n\r\nThese two functions are a lot more predictable for you and will be a lot easier to maintain for me. I'd recommend replacing [bud.assets](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.assets) with them (although I've tried to do what I can to improve it in this release). \r\n\r\n### bud.copyDir\r\n\r\nSee [documentation](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.copyDir) for details.\r\n\r\n### bud.copyFile\r\n\r\nSee [documentation](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.copyFile) for details.\r\n\r\n## Improved errors\r\n\r\nThere is better error handling in a few critical areas. Hopefully you'll never notice.\r\n\r\n### Early errors\r\n\r\nEver make a syntax error in your `bud.config.js` file? Me neither. But if I did the error would happen before bud.js (and it's logger) had even been instantiated. \r\n\r\nNot anymore!\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nError reading config file:\r\nbud.config.mjs appears to be a bud config file, but it could not be imported.\r\n\r\nOriginal error follows:\r\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'\r\n    at file:///bud/sources/@roots/bud/lib/context/config.js:62:31\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### bud.when errors\r\n\r\nIf you pass a non-function argument to [bud.when](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.when) it will throw an error now. I've seen a few people do this and it's an understandable mistake. I'm sorry for the error but it wasn't doing what you wanted before.\r\n\r\nThis is the specific mistake I saw most recently. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/* This will now throw */\r\nbud.when(\r\n  bud.isProduction, \r\n  bud.minimize(), // oops!\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the function is being called right there! It's whatever value the function returns by the time `bud.when` receives it. It doesn't cause a type error but it's obvious something is wrong. \r\n\r\nThe corrected version would just wrap the bud.minimize() call in an arrow function:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.when(\r\n  bud.isProduction, \r\n  () => bud.minimize() // corrected\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, there will be instructions in the console if you are bit by this.\r\n\r\n### Unsupported platform errors\r\n\r\nIf you run bud.js on Windows outside of a WSL environment, it won't try and stop you, but it also won't work. This is mentioned in both the project README.md and [our Getting Started guide](https://bud.js.org/guides/getting-started), and yet many people still post support requests related to errors experienced while using Windows.\r\n\r\nNow, errors are accompanied by a reminder that the platform is not supported, which should hopefully reduce support request volume.\r\n\r\nIf you use Windows and want to see native support for Windows in bud.js please submit an issue and accompanying PR!\r\n\r\n## Improve `bud doctor`\r\n\r\n`bud doctor` now displays additional information about the project and has a couple new checks. \r\n\r\n## Fix: sass/vue/sage (in combination)\r\n\r\nFixes an issue that could create blank stylesheets (with no error thrown from `vue-loader`). Adds reproduction to prevent regressions.\r\n\r\n## Fix: @roots/bud-prettier `format` command\r\n\r\nThanks to @nlemoine for fixing the `bud format` command.\r\n\r\n## Docs contributions\r\n\r\nBig thanks to @dsturm for their continued work improving bud.js' documentation 🙏🏼.",

This serves as a simple replacement for the instructions found in the [compiler sources guide](https://bud.js.org/guides/general-use/compiler-sources).\r\n\r\nIf you have errors which say something along the lines of `You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file.`, this is probably the function you want to use to fix that.\r\n\r\nExample adding support for the swiper lib:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport default async bud => {\r\n  bud.compilePaths([\r\n    bud.path(`@src`),\r\n    bud.path(`@modules/swiper`),\r\n  ])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ✨ improve(@roots/bud): options api [#2078](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2078)\r\n\r\nA small change but a good one. Backwards compatible but it will let us remove a lot of extension methods in bud@7.0.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default async bud => {\r\n    bud.wpjson\r\n      .set(`settings.color.customDuotone`, false)\r\n      .set(`settings.color.customGradient`, false)\r\n      .set(`settings.color.defaultDuotone`, false)\r\n      .set(`settings.color.defaultGradients`, false)\r\n      .set(`settings.color.defaultPalette`, false)\r\n      .set(`settings.color.duotone`, [])\r\n      .enable()\r\n\r\n    bud.tailwind.set(`generateImports`, true)\r\n\r\n    bud.typescript\r\n      .set(`appendTsSuffixTo`, [/\\.vue$/])\r\n      .typecheck.enable()\r\n\r\n    bud.terser\r\n      .set(`extractComments`, false)\r\n      .set(`terserOptions.mangle.safari10`, false)\r\n\r\n    bud.vue.set(`runtimeOnly`, false)\r\n\r\n    bud.imagemin.sharp\r\n      .set(`encodeOptions.png.quality`, 60)\r\n      .set(`encodeOptions.webp.quality`, 60)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan also retrieve options with `get`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nbud.vue.get(`runtimeOnly`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now these dot props are not type safe and you may get feedback in your IDE that the option name doesn't exist. More work is roadmapped to address this, but it's very complicated to do dot notation type transformations on generics with recursive or very deeply nested properties.\r\n\r\nIf this is a problem for you you can do the prop drilling yourself with `extension.getOptions()` and `extension.setOptions()`.",

Fixes [issues referenced in this discourse topic](https://discourse.roots.io/t/errors-when-using-bud-imagemin-for-webp-in-blade-views/24665).\r\n\r\n## ✨ feature(@roots/bud): distinct settings for mapped URLs [#2074](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2074)\r\n\r\nThis is primarily targeted at docker users (including lando), or really anyone who has need for internal/external URLs for the proxy server, dev server, or both.\r\n\r\nAdds the following methods:\r\n\r\n- `bud.setProxyUrl`\r\n- `bud.setPublicProxyUrl`\r\n- `bud.setUrl`\r\n- `bud.setPublicUrl`\r\n\r\nLike `bud.serve` and `bud.proxy` they are pretty flexible and support strings, URL instances or numbers (if you only need to specify the port). If you only specify a port the default interface is used (0.0.0.0).\r\n\r\nSo, a lando user mapping `0.0.0.0` to `example.lndo` can set it up like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default async bud => {\r\n  bud\r\n    .setUrl(3000)\r\n    .setPublicUrl(`http://example.test:3000`)\r\n    .setProxyUrl(8000)\r\n    .setPublicProxyUrl(`http://example.test`)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is especially useful for replacing URLs in proxy responses since the public URLs will be used for find/replace operations. The hope is that you won't have to handle these manually any longer.\r\n\r\nThis change should be backwards compatible with the existing [bud.proxy](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.proxy) and [bud.serve](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.serve) functions. They can be used together and there is no plan on deprecating them:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default async bud => {\r\n  bud\r\n    .proxy('http://0.0.0.0')\r\n    .setPublicProxyUrl('http://example.lndo')\r\n\r\n    .serve('http://0.0.0.0:3000')\r\n    .setPublicUrl('http://example.lndo:3000') \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ✨ feature(@roots/bud-vue): support typescript [#2075](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2075)\r\n\r\nAdds automatic support for typescript in vue single file components. You only need to install [@roots/bud-typescript](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-typescript) and you should be good to go. [Adds an example to the examples directory](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/examples/vue-typescript) and integration tests to ensure this keeps working as the framework develops.\r\n\r\n## ✨ feature(@roots/bud): improve bud cli [#2004](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2004)\r\n\r\nRunning `bud` (no subcommand) presents user with menu of common tasks to select from. `bud doctor` now displays additional information about the project.",

    "body": "## **⚠️ Possible breaking change**\r\n\r\nThere are changes to the API of **@roots/bud-imagemin** to be aware of if you are using that extension and have customized generators or minimizers. \r\n\r\n## ✨ feat(@roots/sage): process blade templates with @roots/blade-loader [#2035](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2035)\r\n\r\nThis is a cool feature.\r\n\r\nMakes it possible to write client code in blade files. This is different than existing solutions because the code is parsed with other loaders (you can write postcss, sass, typescript, etc.)\r\n\r\nSupports: js, ts, css, scss, vue. \r\n\r\nCode is specified using `@js`/`@endjs` syntax (with whatever extension).\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n`index.blade.php`:\r\n```js\r\n@include('sections.header')\r\n\r\n<main id=\"main\" class=\"main\">\r\n  @yield('content')\r\n</main>\r\n\r\n<img src=@asset('images/404.png?as=webp') />\r\n<img src=@asset('images/404.png?as=webp&width=200') />\r\n\r\n@hasSection('sidebar')\r\n  <aside class=\"sidebar\">\r\n    @yield('sidebar')\r\n  </aside>\r\n@endif\r\n\r\n@include('sections.footer')\r\n\r\n@js\r\nimport {render} from '@scripts/render'\r\n\r\nrender(\r\n  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,\r\n  document.getElementById('target-el')\r\n);\r\n@endjs\r\n\r\n@css\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n  @apply bg-blue-500;\r\n}\r\n@endcss\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bud.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbud.entry({\r\n  index: ['views/index']\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncluded in this PR (`sources/@roots/blade-loader/vendor`) are directives that can be used to stop src from rendering (uses `ob_start` and `ob_end_clean`). \r\n\r\nI imagine there will be first-party support added to Sage in the near future. For now, you could try out this feature using blade comments:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{{--\r\n@js\r\nconsole.log('not visible')\r\n@endjs\r\n--}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use [@roots/bud-imagemin](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-imagemin) you can now do image manipulation on-the-fly in blade templates:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<div class=\"test\">\r\n  <img src=@asset('images/foo.png?as=webp&width=100&height=100') alt=\"foo image\" />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWordPress dependencies which are imported are not included in `entrypoints.json`. It's unclear as of yet why. Workaround is to do the imports from a legitimate js module and then import that from the blade file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@js\r\nimport {render} from '@scripts/render'\r\nrender(...)\r\n@endjs\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// @scripts/render.js\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\nimport {render} from 'react-dom'\r\nexport {React, render}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🩹 fix(@roots/wordpress-hmr): duplicative block registrations [#2023](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2023)\r\n\r\nFixes issues in some setups where blocks would be registered more than once.\r\n\r\n## 🩹 fix(cli): --cwd flag [#2008](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2008)\r\n\r\nFixes two related issues which caused the `--cwd`/`--basedir` flag to not work properly\r\n\r\n## 📦 deps: bump node to v18 lts [#1962](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1962)\r\n\r\nnode.js has updated LTS version and so have we. It's fine to use Node 16 in your project for now, but you should upgrade sooner rather than later. \r\n\r\nIt's tentative but we'll likely drop support for older versions of Node in bud v7 (mainly so we can use the new built-in fetch). Previously we were blocked on this due to an issue in GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh but merging [#2012](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2012) has gotten us back on track.\r\n\r\n## 📦 deps(@roots/bud-imagemin): use sharp instead of squoosh [#2012](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2012)\r\n\r\nsquoosh was abandoned by google. we're using sharp internally now. See the PR for details. [API changes are documented on bud.js.org](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-imagemin).\r\n\r\n## ✨ improve(@roots/bud-build): allow adding raw webpack rules [#2010](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2010)\r\n\r\n**Please don't do this in an extension you plan on distributing**.\r\n\r\nDo you just want to add a rule in your project config and don't need to worry about ecosystem compatibility? You can now add rules with standard webpack syntax. Example below but the loaders guide on bud.js.org has been updated to cover this in more detail:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nbud.hooks.on(`build.module.rules.oneOf`, (rules = []) => {\r\n  rules.push({\r\n    test: /\\.example$/,\r\n    use: [\r\n      {\r\n        loader: `babel-loader`,\r\n        options: {\r\n          presets: [`@babel/preset-env`],\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  return rules\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🩹 fix: ensure process exit code is set on compilation error [#1985](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1985)\r\n\r\nFixes [#1986](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/1986). \r\n\r\n[Reproduction incorporated into testing suite to prevent future regressions](https://github.com/roots/bud/blob/main/tests/reproductions/issue-1986.test.ts).",
