This is a quick fix for issues in 6.6.7 with dynamic paths and the `bud upgrade` command

<!--truncate-->

:::info Updates available

There are patches available for [this release](https://bud.js.org/releases/tags/6-6). Please update to [6.6.10](https://bud.js.org/releases/6.6.10).

:::

## Notes

- The fix for dynamic paths deprecates `bud.sage.setAcornVersion` (great that we don't need it!) Keeping the call shouldn't break your build but it will emit a warning to the console telling you to remove it. 
- Both of these issues made into the 6.6.7 because of the complexities inherent to testing the proxy middleware and the CLI (particularly `bud upgrade`). These testing deficiencies will be rectified in the near future.
