## Improvements

### [#2243](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2243) improves compatibility with pnpm

This change finishes work started in 6.12.2 make it less necessary to use [the bud.js .pnpmfile.cjs compatibility shim](https://bud.js.org/guides/general-use/pnpm#pnpmfilecjs-compatibilty-shim). 

You should also now be able to limit hoisting to `@roots` packages, if desired:

```
pnpm install --public-hoist-pattern="@roots/*"
```

When only hoisting `@roots/*` packages you will need to make sure your app dependencies are explicitly defined. Rule of thumb: if you import it in your app you will need to have it installed in your project. 

The alternative is to hoist everything (same behavior as npm and yarn):

```
pnpm install --public-hoist-pattern="*"
```

## Fixes

- Fixes module resolution cache validation when swapping package managers.
- Fixes issue with eslint not outputting to stdout/stderr in some configurations.
