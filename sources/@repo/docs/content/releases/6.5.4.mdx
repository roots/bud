## ‚ú® improve(patch): clean up stack traces (#1773)

There should be less duplication of emitted errors, more meaningful stack traces, and highlighting of important
parts of the error message.

## ‚ú® improve(patch): improve env interpolations (#1856)

Envvars sourced from .env files in the path to the project are now interpolated using env-expand.
If you have an unescaped string that causes the expansion to fail the error will be caught and
you should be gracefully downgraded.

## üéâ feat(none): `bud upgrade` command (#1855)

Run `bud upgrade` to upgrade your project bud dependencies to the latest available version.

## ü©π fix(patch): reload browser on watched files add/unlink (#1781)

When files are added or removed from a path matching a watched file, the browser will now reload.

## üß™ test(none): migrate jest to vitest (#1850)

This should have no bearing on your project but we switched from jest to vitest and it's pretty cool.
