## 🩹 Fix: resolved paths containing spaces

Paths resolved by bud.js's module resolve utility had spaces replaced with `%20` in the path. This replacement was being made
by `import-module-resolve`'s `resolve` function, which treats paths as browser-compatible URIs.

This small patch replaces `%20` with ` ` (U+0020) before returning resolved paths.
