Incremental improvements and fixes for core bud features.

<!--truncate-->

## New package: `@roots/eslint-config`

Eslint configs have been centralized in the new `@roots/eslint-config` package.

| Name        | Import                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| defaults    | `@roots/eslint-config`             |
| react       | `@roots/eslint-config/react`       |
| recommended | `@roots/eslint-config/recommended` |
| typescript  | `@roots/eslint-config/typescript`  |
| wordpress   | `@roots/eslint-config/wordpress`   |
| sage        | `@roots/eslint-config/sage`        |

If you are using a `@roots` eslint config please use the appropriate export from `@roots/eslint-config` instead. **These exports will be removed in 5.5.0**.

## CLI Improvements

We've replaced oclif with clipanion. Clipanion is the same library that powers yarn. Additionally, exception handling has been enhanced to give better feedback
when something goes wrong before compilation begins.

The `--no-dashboard` flag has been deprecated (since the output is now equally safe in CI or in development). Also, by default bud now runs with logging disabled.
If you prefer the verbose logging you can enable it with the `--log` flag.

## Improved resolution for modules outside `src`

By default, `bud` only transpiles modules found in the project `src` directory. This is excellent for most projects -- it limits the number of
directories bud will try and resolve from and speeds things up immensely. The vast majorty of modules come precompiled.

But, certain packages ship modules as source code for you to transpile as part of your build.
Of course, you can specify directories to act as additional module sources. It used to require _a bit_ more work, but now it's easier.

Here's an example where we'll make it possible to resolve source code from `some-npm-pkg`:

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setIncludes([
  require.resolve('src'),
  require.resolve('node_modules/some-npm-pkg'),
])
```

You could just open up the entire project `setIncludes([app.path('project')])` but that will make compilation needlessly slow.

## Improved: anchor tag `onClick` interceptor (for proxy dev)

Link clicks should more reliably keep you "stuck" to the dev server rather than sending you back out to the proxied site. This was a small change
but hopefully makes for happy deving.
