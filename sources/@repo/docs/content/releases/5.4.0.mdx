## Heads up

- ⚠️ Eslint configs have been centralized in the new `@roots/eslint-config` package. If you are using a `@roots` eslint config please use the appropriate export from `@roots/eslint-config` instead. **These exports will be removed in 5.5.0**.
- ⚠️ Verbose logging is now disabled by default. To enable logging use the `--log` flag.
- ⚠️ `@roots/sage` users no longer need to specify paths in `package.json`. You can remove the `bud` key entirely.
