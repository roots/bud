This is essentially a patch but it's being treated as a minor release because some tailwindcss snapshots have changed since 6.23.3. Despite the differences, the build output seems normal and generally these sorts of changes are to be expected as dependencies are upgraded; I wouldn't anticipate needing to make any changes to your project in response. At the same time, it seems like a bit too much to qualify as a straightforward patch. 6.24.0 it is, then!

## Housekeeping

Sorry for the delay on this release; I've gotten a new job and recently had a surgery which took me out of the OSS game, briefly. It feels good to finally release this. 

We're getting ready to start working on version 7 in earnest, and I'll publish a blog or something soon regarding the direction we're going in.

Thanks to @joshuafredrickson and @Dyras for their contributions.
