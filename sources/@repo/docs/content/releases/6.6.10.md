## 🔧 decouple theme json from @roots/sage ([#1982](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1982))

<!--truncate-->

Breaks the `bud.wpjson` feature from `@roots/sage` into two extensions and a webpack plugin to be combined as needed in projects. `@roots/sage` now includes these extensions as part of the preset it provides. See the PR for details.

## 🩹 fix(@roots/sage): serve options including hostname ([#1983](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1983))

Fixes an issue where setting a proper hostname (fully qualified URL or string; rather than an interface or a port) would cause proxied assets to 500.

## 🩹 fix: ensure process exit code is set on compilation error ([#1985](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1985))

Fixes an issue where process exit code would not be set to 1 even if an error is not explicitly thrown by compiler. Adds integration test to protect against regressions.

## 📦 dependencies: improve peer dependencies

Better defines peer dependencies. This should hep guarantee a flat `node_modules` and an easier time for users of package managers with stricter peer dependencies resolution strategies (like pnpm).
