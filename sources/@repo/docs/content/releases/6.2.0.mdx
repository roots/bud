## üéâ SWC support

This release introduces a new extension: [@roots/bud-swc](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-swc).

The extension registers support for  [swc](https://swc.rs). 

You can try it out by installing `@roots/bud-swc`. Hopefully it "just works" out of the box for you, but [check out the docs](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-swc) for details on [how to configure swc](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-swc#configuration) for your project.

If you have the extension installed `@roots/bud` will privilege it over `@roots/bud-babel` when it is available. So, you really can give it a go by just adding `@roots/bud-swc` to your project dependencies when upgrading.

The swc project claims upwards of _a 70x performance improvement over babel_. I don't see that in testing (MacOS ARM arch), but it is definitely faster (~20%).

I hear the difference is particularly pronounced in WSL2, although my means to test that is limited. Let me know how it goes!

## Better dev experience using @roots/bud-react

For projects using a combination of `@roots/bud-react` and either `@roots/bud-typescript`, `@roots/bud-swc` and/or `@roots/bud-babel`, react fast refresh is now enabled by default.

If you don't want react fast refresh then you can disable it with:

```ts
bud.react.refresh.disable()
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you are currently configuring fast-refresh using `bud.reactRefresh()` you will need to update your call to use the new API.**

Change this:

```ts
bud.reactRefresh(true)
```

to this:

```ts
bud.react.refresh.enable()
```

## babel is now optional when using @roots/bud-typescript

Depending on your project you may be able to use typescript without babel. Why not try it and find out?

```ts
bud.typescript.useBabel(false)
```

If you disable babel react-refresh will be enabled using the `react-refresh-typescript` compiler plugin instead.

## @roots/bud-terser is now a core extension

If you have installed this extension directly to your project you can remove it.

If you are using the new SWC extension terser will automatically be configured to use the swc minifier.

## Fix: zero config hmr client script injection

There was an issue with client scripts not being injected in zero configuration setups (more specifically: any setup that didn't explicitly set entrypoints with [bud.entry](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.entry)).

It's been corrected; see [#1506](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1506) for details

## New command: `bud typecheck`

TypeScript users can call `bud typecheck` to run typechecking outside of compilation. There are a couple requirements, at least for this initial effort:

- You must have `typescript` installed
- You must have a `tsconfig.json` in your project root

This is honestly not much more than a `tsc --noEmit` alias right now.

But, it might be useful for you as-is and it will get better and more useful in future releases.
