A big change for dependency management with a couple very important bug fixes.

<!--truncate-->

## @roots/sage: `setPublicPath` deprecation

`bud.setPublicPath` is deprecated when using the `@roots/sage` preset.

Setting the public path in roots/sage will break builds now that it is no longer needed (it'll end up doubling up URLs in Acorn). We know that's annoying so `@roots/sage` (the extension) overrides `setPublicPath` with a function that intentionally lets the passed value fall through.

The function is flagged as `@deprecated` and will be marked as such in most modern IDEs. You should remove it from your config before roots/sage leaves beta.

See [improve(server) proxy middleware (](https://github.com/roots/bud/commit/94a208a7a9edb7d0f304a08986c98424cc743831)[#1008](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1008)[)](https://github.com/roots/bud/commit/94a208a7a9edb7d0f304a08986c98424cc743831)

## Directly installing dependencies is optional

In Bud v5.0.0 and v5.1.0 it became very clear that the framework's way of handling dependency management was not working anywhere near as well as we had hoped it would. I'd estimate over half of the problems brought up had to do with mismatched dependencies.

The `bud install` command was meant to make it easy. I wouldn't say it made it _harder_, but it definitely didn't make it _easy_.

For v5.2.0 we're doing something really different and much more in keeping with other tools that work similarly to bud (nextjs, create-react-app, etc). We're going to include the batteries.

This means users do not need to specify anything in `package.json` outside of the extension they want to use. So, if you want to try `@roots/bud-sass` you just install the extension. No need to run `bud install` or manually add `sass`. It should already be at the top level of `node_modules`, a proper peer to your project, ready to be resolved.

**Compare the roots/sage manifest from 5.1.0:**

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@babel/eslint-parser": "^7.16.5",
    "@roots/bud": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/bud-eslint": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/bud-postcss": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/bud-prettier": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/bud-stylelint": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/bud-tailwindcss": "^5.1.0",
    "@roots/sage": "^5.1.0",
    "@wordpress/browserslist-config": "4.1.0",
    "eslint": "8.6.0",
    "postcss": "8.4.5",
    "postcss-import": "14.0.2",
    "postcss-nested": "5.0.6",
    "postcss-preset-env": "7.1.0",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
    "tailwindcss": "3.0.8",
    "prettier": "2.5.1"
}
```

**to the one for 5.2.0:**

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@roots/bud": "5.2.0",
  "@roots/bud-eslint": "5.2.0",
  "@roots/bud-postcss": "5.2.0",
  "@roots/bud-prettier": "5.2.0",
  "@roots/bud-stylelint": "5.2.0",
  "@roots/bud-tailwindcss": "52.0",
  "@roots/sage": "5.2.0"
}
```

It seems like it's going to be a lot more manageable. For bud users and maintainers.

Users can still override the installed version of any dependency by installing it themselves. Bud has also relaxed its verison requirements to be much more tolerant of discrepencies.

See [improve(bud) dependency strategy (](https://github.com/roots/bud/commit/898a54afdd11cd963526cd9b395c199e49d037fa)[#1005](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1005)[)](https://github.com/roots/bud/commit/898a54afdd11cd963526cd9b395c199e49d037fa)

## Easier stylelint configs

When relevant, all extensions now come with a stylelint export for you to use as a starting point.

Here's a config that works well with `tailwindcss`:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@roots/bud-stylelint/config",
    "@roots/bud-tailwindcss/stylelint-config"
  ]
}
```

And if a user wants to try `tailwindcss` in a `sass` stylesheet, they no longer need to figure out how to do that themselves.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@roots/sage/stylelint-config",
    "@roots/bud-tailwindcss/stylelint-config",
    "@roots/bud-sass/stylelint-config"
  ]
}
```

This release should be able to close the door on issues like [[#731] CSS lint errors for SCSS stylesheet files (e.g. `Unknown word`; ...)](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/731)

Here's the list of modules:

| extension                | export                                      |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `@roots/bud-stylelint`   | `'@roots/bud-stylelint/config'`             |
| `@roots/bud-tailwindcss` | `'@roots/bud-tailwindcss/stylelint-config'` |
| `@roots/bud-sass`        | `'@roots/bud-sass/stylelint-config'`        |
| `@roots/sage`            | `'@roots/sage/stylelint-config'`            |

## Easier eslint configs

There are a number of configs available to use in your eslint config as a base:

```js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: [
    require.resolve('@roots/sage/eslint-config'),
    require.resolve('@roots/bud-prettier/eslint-config'),
  ],
}
```

Here's the list of modules:

| extension                     | export                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `@roots/bud-eslint`           | `'@roots/bud-eslint/eslint-config'`           |
| `@roots/bud-babel`            | `'@roots/bud-babel/eslint-config'`            |
| `@roots/bud-preset-wordpress` | `'@roots/bud-preset-wordpress/eslint-config'` |
| `@roots/bud-preset-recommend` | `'@roots/bud-preset-recommend/eslint-config'` |
| `@roots/bud-prettier`         | `'@roots/bud-prettier/eslint-config'`         |
| `@roots/bud-react`            | `'@roots/bud-react/eslint-config'`            |
| `@roots/sage`                 | `'@roots/sage/eslint-config'`                 |

## Fixes and improvements

- Setting a `publicPath` no longer needed for proxy ðŸŽ‰
- Fixes `INVALID_URL` error message emitted by `HPM` logger
- `bud.use` was not configured behind a facade. It is now a synchronous interface over an asynchronous function (like the rest of the async fns in `@roots/bud-api`). This was obviously causing issues (see https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/1003#issuecomment-1017950712). A unit test has been added to make sure it returns `Framework` and not `Promise<Framework>`
- `bud.splitChunks` now breaks all of the "dev boilerplate" (think: hot reload scripts, core-js polyfills, webpack client code, ansi parsers, bud's client scripts, etc.) into a separate chunkGroup: `vendor/bud.js`. This cleanly separates vendor code (being used by the app), "bud" code, and the application code. This doesn't effect production at all since none of the packages in the bud chunk group are used outside of dev.
- Fixes `bud.watch`.
