<!--This file is generated-->

Improvements in 6.17.0 are mainly focused on `@roots/bud-purgecss` and `@roots/bud-stylelint` APIs. Also includes a way for community extensions to indicate compatibility with specific bud.js releases. This allows [community extension](https://github.com/roots/bud#community-extensions) authors to version their work independently of bud.js core and for users to update extensions along with core packages using the `bud upgrade` command ([#2444](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/2444)).

Also includes a few minor bug fixes and updates to transitive dependencies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### @roots/bud-postcss

Sensible defaults are applied automatically, making this extension zero config. There is a much better API available using `bud.purge` rather than `bud.purgecss`. 

- lf you have installed the extension but are not using it you will either want to remove the extension or explicitly disable it: `bud.purge.enable(false)`.
- `bud.purgecss` function is deprecated. You should configure purgecss using the extension API exposed with `bud.purge`. `bud.purge.setOptions` works exactly the same way as `bud.purgecss` does, but there is now a new, fully fluent API available to you as well.
- `bud.purgecss` will not be removed until v7.
