Small fixes and improvements related to `argv`, `package.json` and `.env` settings.

<!--truncate-->

## ü©π Fix: `argv` parsing

These flags were janky but now they are golden:

- `--devtool` - Set desired devtool
- `--clean` - Enable or disable build cleaning
- `--discovery` - Enable or disable automatic extension registration
- `--flush` - Clean webpack cache

This release also adds a `--runtime` flag, which is new. It doesn't accept everything `bud.runtime` does, but you can use it to specify basic options like `single`, `multiple`, or `true` (which will use the default: `single`).

## ‚ú® Improve: `env` context

You can set values in your `.env`:

- `APP_BASE_PATH` - the base path for your app
- `APP_PUBLIC_PATH` - the public path for your app
- `APP_SRC_PATH` - the `@src` path for your app
- `APP_DIST_PATH` - the `@dist` path for your app
- `APP_STORAGE_PATH` - the `@storage` path for your app
- `APP_MODE` - desired build mode

## ‚ú® Improve: `package.json` context

The options available under the `bud` key in `package.json` have been expanded:

```json5
{
  "bud": {
    "paths": {
      "base": string,
      "src": string,
      "dist": string,
      "storage": string
    },
    "publicPath": string,
    "extensions": {
      "allowlist": string[],
      "denylist": string[],
      "discovery": boolean
    }
  }
}
```
