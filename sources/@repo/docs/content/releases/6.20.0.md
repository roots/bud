## Fixed: module reload problems

The origin of this problem stems from WordPress not enqueuing assets that depend on `wp-react-refresh-runtime` if the WordPress config variable `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is not `true`. bud.js will now check the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` env variable, and if `true` will use `wp-react-refresh-runtime`. Otherwise, that runtime will be included in the bundle and the script dependency will be left undeclared. In lieu of an environment variable you can call `bud.wp.setScriptDebug(true)` in your bud.js configuration.

If you opt in (either by calling the config function or setting the environment variable) you must make sure it is set in your WordPress config. If you do nothing, you'll probably be fine, but we recommend either setting the environment variable or calling the new config function if you experience conflicts between the WordPress core dev runtime and bud.js dev runtime.

## Feature: Support for mapping tailwindcss `theme.spacing` values to theme.json

Call `bud.wp.json.useTailwindSpacing()` to source spacing values from your tailwind config.

## Fix: Node 16 compatibility

Downgraded globby from v14 to v13 so as to maintain compatibility with Node 16. We will be moving to Node 20 with the next major release of bud.js but we want to maintain compatibility with Node 16 for all bud.js 6.x.x releases. You should see major benefits in performance and reliability using Node 20 so we definitely recommend upgrading as soon as possible, if you can.
