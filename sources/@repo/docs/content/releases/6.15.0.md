<!--This file is generated-->

This release is mostly focused on maintaining and improving existing features. The one new feature lets you opt-out of externalizing certain WordPress dependencies (if you are using @roots/bud-preset-wordpress or @roots/sage). For more information check out [the updated @roots/bud-preset-wordpress docs](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress).

:::info Updates available

There are patches available for [this release](https://bud.js.org/releases/tags/6-15). Please update to [6.15.2](https://bud.js.org/releases/6.15.2).

:::

## ⚠️ Potentially breaking change

@roots/sage: previously `bud.splitChunks('single')` was called for production builds. This is no longer the default for two reasons:
  1. If you have an editor entrypoint and an app entrypoint (common), it is possible that editor dependencies could be extracted into the common chunk. This can lead to Acorn enqueuing those dependencies for both `app` and `editor`, even if they were only used in one (since the shared vendor module contains references to the dependencies). 
  2. This is very easy to address as part of your application and that approach is preferred. Especially now that top-level async/await is available for bud.js application modules. 
  3. If you really want a vendors chunk, just call `bud.splitChunks()` or pass the `--splitChunks` flag.
