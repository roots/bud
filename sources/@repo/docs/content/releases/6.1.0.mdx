## Fix: bud.assets

This release makes some changes to [bud.assets](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.assets) in response to feedback from the [roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) team and members of the [Roots Discourse community](https://discourse.roots.io). Specifically, you will find that directories listed in the `bud.assets` call will have their structure preserved in the `@dist` directory.

### accounting for the path change

After upgrading, it is possible that assets will be emitted to a different directory than you expect. Likely you are anticipating that copied files will be available in the root of `@dist` and are finding them now in a subdirectory.

You can specify the dist root as a target to compensate for the change:

```js title="bud.config.js"
// from this (will copy from images dir to dist/images)
bud.assets(['images'])

// to this (will copy from images dir to dist)
bud.assets([['images', './']])
```

### bud.assets api change

bud.assets is no longer variadic. If you are specifying copy jobs using multiple parameters just wrap them in an array:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
// from this
bud.assets('images', 'fonts')

// to this
bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
```

## Feature: `bud.denylist`

Bud extensions are automatically utilized in a build if they are listed under the `devDependencies` or `dependencies` field of `package.json`.
They are also automatically utilized when marked as a dep of another extension.

You can add a `bud.denylist` field to `package.json` to prevent certain extensions from being registered, regardless.

```json
{
  "bud": {
    "denylist": ["@roots/bud-criticalcss"]
  }
}
```

There is also a `bud.allowlist` to whitelist extensions. You should be aware that there are many internal extensions, and things may break if they are not available. If you run a build with the `--log` flag the tapped extensions will be summarized at the bottom, but it's probably better to use `bud.denylist`.

## Improve: `@roots/bud-preset-recommend`

### Use `@roots/bud-esbuild` over `@roots/bud-babel` when possible

The `@roots/bud-preset-recommend` extension will check to see if `@roots/bud-esbuild` is available before registering `@roots/bud-babel`.
This didn't cause errors prior to 6.1.0, but it did have a cost in terms of build time for users of `@roots/bud-preset-recommend` who wanted to use `@roots/bud-esbuild` iorf `@roots/bud-typescript` instead of `@roots/bud-babel`.

## Improve: @roots/sage

A few changes here:

### `domReady` now async compatible

The `domReady` named export of `@roots/sage/client` can now take an async callback:

```js 
import {domReady} from '@roots/sage/client'

domReady(async () => {
  // do async stuff
})
```

### New `theme.json` features

⚠️ **If you were already using **bud.js** to generate `theme.json` for WordPress, you will need to update your call.**

All the methods are now housed under `bud.wpjson`. You must also call `bud.wpjson.enable` in order to actually emit the file.

```js
bud.wpjson
  .useTailwindColors()
  .settings(theme => {
    theme.set('prop')
  })
  .enable()
```

#### Use tailwind font sizes and families in `theme.json`

In addition to the theme color palette, you can now generate font sizes and font families from `tailwind.config.js` using `bud.wpjson.useTailwindFontSize` and `bud.wpjson.useTailwindFontFamily`.

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
app.wpjson
  .useTailwindColors()
  .useTailwindFontSize()
  .useTailwindFontFamily()
  .enable()
```

You can also modify fields which are not under the `settings` key using the standard extension API's `setOptions` method:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
// callback
app.wpjson.setOptions(opts => ({
  ...options,
  customTemplates: [],
}))

// literal
app.wpjson.setOptions({
  // using without a callback
  // will fully override theme.json
  ...app.wpjson.options,
})
```

[Check the updated @roots/sage docs](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage) for additional usage guidance.

## Fix: ts-bud incompatible with bud.typescript.typecheck

The fix for this issue is pretty in the weeds but [you can read about it in #1492](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1492).

## Fix: `@roots/bud-eslint` incompatible with filesystem caching

Previously users of `@roots/bud-eslint` needed to use `bud.persist('memory')` in order to guarantee linting worked as expected. This is no longer the case [thanks to #1492](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/1492).
