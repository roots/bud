This is a relatively big release but should not require any changes to your project configuration.

<!--truncate-->

Node.js LTS is now 20.10 and bud.js has adopted it. We are still not doing anything that requires it but `bud doctor` will warn you to upgrade Node.js if you're still on 18 and will _really_ warn you if you are using an even earlier version.

Previously, **@roots/browserslist-config** would update the can-i-use database as a post install script. This check has been moved into the bud.js application, running before compilation. It runs once per week and only if you have defined a `browserslist` property in `package.json`. It can be disabled by [setting an environment variable](https://bud.js.org/learn/config/files/env#configurable-environment-variables) (`BUD_BROWSERSLIST_UPDATE=false`), or with the `--no-browserslist-update` flag.

## Fixed

- Fixes an issue where sometimes a stale error notification would persist in the browser even after it was fixed in source.
- Fixes an issue where sometimes installations could hang when using Yarn v3+.

## New

- **[bud.addConfig](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.addConfig)**: config function which accepts  a path to another config file to run. 
- **[bud.lazy](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.lazy)**: config function to configure lazy compilation settings.

## Improved

- [bud.devtool](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.devtool), [bud.hash](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.hash) [bud.minimize](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.minimize), [bud.persist](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.persist), and [bud.runtime](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.runtime) now accept `Bud` as an argument so they can be more readily combined with functions like [bud.when](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.when) (e.g. `bud.when(bud.isDevelopment, bud.devtool)`).
- [bud.hash](https://bud.js.org/reference/bud.hash): Now accepts the hash generation function as a string, if you want to customize it. 
- **`--runtime` flag**: now accepts a string argument (e.g. `--runtime=single`, `--runtime=multiple`). It can still be used as a boolean flag: (e.g. `--runtime`, `--no-runtime`). 
- **[bud build development](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/build/development)**: Help menu with keyboard shortcuts (toggle with `h`).
- YML configs now support dot notation in config keys. See [updated documentation](https://bud.js.org/learn/config/files/bud.config#configuring-budjs-with-yml).
- **[bud repl](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/repl)**: This command is now more responsive to terminal window sizing (it was previously capped at 10 rows). 
- **[bud clean](https://bud.js.org/learn/cli/clean)**: This command now only lists directories which it actually removed.
- All extensions now have a `done` method which returns the bud instance, for better chaining.
- General improvements to logging (`--log`).
- General improvements to exception handling.
- Code minimizers (terser, etc.) are lazy loaded only when they are used, which is a performance gain.
- html-webpack-plugin is lazy loaded only when it is being used, which is a performance gain.
