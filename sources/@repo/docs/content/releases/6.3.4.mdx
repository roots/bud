## 🩹 Fix: conditionally add/remove `bud-error` component

The `bud-error` component is now only added to the DOM only when there is an error and is removed when there is not.

## ✨ Improve: public env values

The [bud.env docs have been updated](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.env) to reflect the actual intended use of public env variables:

```env tile=".env"
PUBLIC_APP_NAME="My App"
```

```js title="app.js"
console.log(APP_NAME)
```

Previously, the envvars would have needed to include quotations in order to be output as a string (as in: `PUBLIC_APP_NAME="'My App'"`).
Now, they are passed through `JSON.stringify` automatically.

## ✨ Improve: prevent repeated attempts to import optional dependencies

A number of extensions will attempt to use dependencies if they are available, falling back to more common
dependencies if they are not. Previously, bud.js would attempt to import the dependencies repeatedly, in cases
where more than one extension tried for the same optional, uninstalled dependency.

Not sure that this matters much in terms of performance because of the way that esmodules are cached. But, at the very least,
it cleans up the logs a bit.

## 🩹 Fix: `@roots/bud-tailwindcss/stylelint-config/scss` error

Hattip to @joshuafredrickson for the PR fixing this module import error.
