## Fix: early process exit on errors thrown from loaders, even in development

An error thrown by Sass in development mode would cause the process to exit early. This issue could effect other plugins, but it surfaced via reports by `@roots/bud-sass` users.

Regardless, the fix is general and should apply to all extensions.
