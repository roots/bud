:::info Updates available

There are patches available for [this release](https://bud.js.org/releases/tags/5-8). Please update to [5.8.1](https://bud.js.org/releases/5.8.1).

:::

## Heads up

### **@roots/bud-eslint** 

There is an upstream issue (with eslint-webpack-plugin) which causes the linter to show no errors after the initial compilation, regardless of any violations.

Until this is resolved, you should use `memory` caching. You can enable this with:

```ts file="bud.config.js"
bud.persist('memory')
```

This issue is present in earlier versions of **bud.js**.

### **@roots/bud-typescript**

The typings for the `Bud` object in **bud.js** have been consolidated under a single interface/namespace: `Bud`.
If you are using [@roots/bud-typescript](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-typescript), please update your config file and any type declarations to use `Bud` instead of `Framework`. 

Sorry for the inconvenience. Consider it a trade for much improved intellisense.

## Flexible extensions

It is now possible, in extensions which support it, to utilize user-defined dependencies over built-in ones (if they are present in the project `package.json`).

This means that you can now use **Vue 2** instead of **Vue 3**, if desired. This is done by installing the `Vue 2` compatible packages directly. These versions are the ones we currently run integration tests for:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@roots/bud": "latest",
    "@roots/bud-vue": "latest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^2.6.14",
    "vue-template-compiler": "^2.6.14",
    "vue-loader": "^15.9.4"
  }
}
```

Check out the [vue legacy example](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/examples/vue-legacy) for a working example of Vue 2 being used with **bud.js**.

In the future, additional extensions will follow suit. Some may already have support (it's simply not being advertised since this is a new feature).

Note that by utilizing custom versions of packages you are opting in to increased responsibility for your project. We only support what ships with **bud.js** by default.

## bud.proxy url replacements

You can now substitute in or amend the existing string replacements for proxy responses. See the updated documentation for more details: [bud.proxy](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.proxy).

## bud.glob

You can glob for files with [bud.glob](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.glob). There is a sync version available as well: [bud.globSync](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.globSync).

## `--editor` flag

Pass the `--editor` flag to the `build` command to open errors in your preferred editor. It's required for you to have set your preferred editor with either the `EDITOR` or `VISUAL` environment variables. 

If `VISUAL` is set, it will preferred over `EDITOR`.

## `--browser` flag

Pass the `--browser` flag to the `build` command to open the built site in your browser.

## @roots/sage

[bud.useTailwindColors](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage#defining-themejson-colors-from-tailwindconfigjs) now supports nested color groups. So, you can do stuff like this:

```js
{
  blue: {
    shade: {
      hue: {
        '50': '#add8e6',
      },
    },
    group: {
      sky: '#87ceeb',
    },
  },
  tomato: '#ff4500',
}
```

## @roots/bud-esbuild

This extension got a big overhaul in v5.8.0. Including unit tests! Check out [the updated docs](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-esbuild).

## core

This release is mainly focused on the [@roots/bud-extensions] API. Extensions can now be registered using ES6 classes. But, they can also be passed around as plain objects, as before.

Documentation is still a work-in-progress but has been largely updated to reflect the new API.
