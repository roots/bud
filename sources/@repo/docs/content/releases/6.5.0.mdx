Some much-needed filesystem functionality, a way to

<!--truncate-->

## ✨ bud.fs

`bud.fs` is a new service that provides a filesystem API for bud. It uses [fs-jetpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-jetpack) and includes support for managing s3 assets.

Example usage which uploads `@dist` contents to a bucket after compilation:

```typescript
app.fs
  .setCredentials({
    accessKeyId: `***`,
    secretAccessKey: `***`,
  })
  .setEndpoint(`https://sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com`)
  .setBucket('bud-test')
  .upload()
```

Check [the bud.fs docs](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.fs) for more information.

## ✨ bud.after

Config function for executing tasks after the compilation is fully complete. This is useful for tasks that need to run after the compilation is complete, but don't need to be part of the compilation process (like uploading assets to s3!)

```typescript
bud.after(async bud => {
  await bud.fs.s3.write({Key: 'example.test', Body: 'Hello, world!'})
})
```

Check [the bud.after docs](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.after) for more information.
