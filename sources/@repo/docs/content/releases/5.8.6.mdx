:::info Updates available

There are patches available for [this release](https://bud.js.org/releases/tags/5-8). Please update to [5.8.7](https://bud.js.org/releases/5.8.7).

:::

1. Users of [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage) who are using [dynamic imports](https://bud.js.org/guides/general-use/dynamic-imports) can now use [`bud.setPublicPath`](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.setPublicPath) without causing issues with acorn. It's also fine to continue setting the publicPath in the `entry` call.

2. Fixes an issue with `bud.assets` that resulted in the hash not being applied to copied filenames.
