## üö® breaking: bud.entry no longer parses files as globs

You can use [bud.glob](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.glob) if you have need for this.

Example:

```ts title="bud.config.mjs"
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry({
    app: await bud.glob(`@src/*.{js,css}`),
  })
}
```

## üö® breaking: builtin extension keys are normalized

If you were using one of these labels directly, you'll need to update it. The upshot of this is that your editor will likely not only tell you that it's wrong but also offer the new key as a suggestion.

## ‚ú® improve: Can use package signifiers with `bud.extensions.add` and `bud.use`

Very convenient! Works for webpack plugins or bud.js extensions.

```js
bud.use('browsersync-webpack-plugin')
```

```js
await bud.extensions.add('browsersync-webpack-plugin')
```

This will only work if the plugin/extension is the `default` export.

## ‚ú® improve: improve env interpolation (#1856)

Variables sourced from .env files in the path to the project are now interpolated using env-expand.
Previously, only the project directory would be expanded.

If you have an unescaped string that causes the expansion to fail the error will be caught.

## ‚ú® improve: `@roots/bud-client` now better supports multi-compiler

Each bud.js instance's entrypoints are now registered with `@roots/bud-client/hot`. This helps to prevent conflicts
with reloaded modules when using multiple bud instances.

Some notes:

- Each instance now declares each previous instance as a dependency. This allows the [bud.runtime](https://bud.js.org/docs/runtime) to work even when using
  multiple instances.
- If you are using [bud.runtime](https://bud.js.org/docs/runtime) you will need to make sure that you are specifying `single`.
- If you want to modify the instance dependencies manually, you can use the (new) `build.dependencies` hook. Or, specify the dependencies in the `context` argument
  passed to [bud.make](https://bud.js.org/docs/make).
- The [bud.make](https://bud.js.org/docs/make) docs have been updated.

Example of a custom `dependsOn` when setting up a child instance:

```js
bud.make({
  label: `example`,
  basedir: bud.path(`example`),
  dependsOn: [`some-other-instance`],
})
```

## üéâ feat: `bud upgrade` command (#1855)

Run `bud upgrade` to bump bud dependencies to the latest available version.
You will need to run the install after the command completes. This is a new command and is not yet unit tested.

## @roots/bud-swc

### üéâ feat: `@roots/bud-swc` plugins are configurable

Call `bud.swc.plugins` to manage `@swc/core` plugins. You can pass an array of plugins (as demonstrated in the swc docs) or a callback
if you want to modify what's already there:

```js
bud.swc.plugins(plugins => {
  plugins.push([`swc-plugin`, {option: true}])
})
```

If you haven't tried `@roots/bud-swc` you should consider it. This extension is no longer considered experimental. There is a strong
case to be made for it replacing `@roots/bud-babel` in `@roots/bud-preset-recommmend` for version 7 of bud.js.

## @roots/bud-emotion

### üéâ feat: `@roots/bud-emotion` now supports `@roots/bud-swc`

If you have `@roots/bud-swc` installed, `@roots/bud-emotion` will register emotion support with `@swc/core`.

## @roots/bud-criticalcss

### üéâ feat: `bud.critical.extract`

Disable critical CSS extraction by calling `bud.critical.extract(false)`. This isn't generally recommended.

[@roots/bud-criticalcss](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-criticalcss) remains an experimental extension.

## @roots/sage

### ü©π fix: proxy assets load when in dev mode

This fix requires acorn v3 and you must set a public path. You can opt-in with `bud.sage.setAcornVersion('v3')`.

With the acorn version set to `v3` assets should load when using the proxy directly in dev mode.
You will still see 404 errors for the `/bud/hot` endpoint.

## Internal changes

Nothing is required of you, but if you're curious, here's what's changed:

### ü©π fix: reload browser on watched files add/unlink (#1781)

When files are added or removed from a watched directory path the browser will now reload.

### üè∑Ô∏è typings: mapped extension options

You should now get useful, accurate intellisense and typechecking when using the `bud.extensions` api directly.

### ‚ú® improve: CLI feedback when using `bud.serve` in a child compiler

It warns you to move it to the parent context. For now it also does this for you since it's an understandable mistake and
will result in a `TypeError`.

### ‚ú® improve: clean up stack traces (#1773)

There should be less duplication of emitted errors, more meaningful stack traces, and highlighting of important
parts of the error message.

### ‚öôÔ∏è internal: use `nodenext` to resolve node modules

We're using the `nodenext` tsc `module` setting. This enables top-level `await` for core bud,js packages ü•≥.

### ‚öôÔ∏è internal: @roots/bud-api is now fully type-safe

`strict` mode is enabled! We're beginning to implement runtime validation using [zod](https://zod.dev).

### üß™ test: migrate jest to vitest (#1850)

We switched from jest to vitest because of esm compatibility issues. It's pretty nice!
Hopefully we'll be able to run unit tests on the CLI now.
