## ðŸ©¹ fix(@roots/sage): blade loader caching [#2065](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2065)

Improves regular expression used to extract `@asset` URLs and fixes caching for blade partials. Fixes [issues referenced in this discourse topic](https://discourse.roots.io/t/errors-when-using-bud-imagemin-for-webp-in-blade-views/24665).

## âœ¨ feature(@roots/bud): distinct settings for mapped URLs [#2074](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2074)

This is primarily targeted at docker users (including lando), or really anyone who has need for internal/external URLs for the proxy server, dev server, or both.

Adds the following methods:

- `bud.setProxyUrl`
- `bud.setPublicProxyUrl`
- `bud.setUrl`
- `bud.setPublicUrl`

Like `bud.serve` and `bud.proxy` they are pretty flexible and support strings, URL instances or numbers (if you only need to specify the port). If you only specify a port the default interface is used (0.0.0.0).

So, a lando user mapping `0.0.0.0` to `example.lndo` can set it up like so:

```ts
export default async bud => {
  bud
    .setUrl(3000)
    .setPublicUrl(`http://example.test:3000`)
    .setProxyUrl(8000)
    .setPublicProxyUrl(`http://example.test`)
}
```

This is especially useful for replacing URLs in proxy responses since the public URLs will be used for find/replace operations. The hope is that you won't have to handle these manually any longer.

This change should be backwards compatible with the existing [bud.proxy](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.proxy) and [bud.serve](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.serve) functions. They can be used together and there is no plan on deprecating them:

```ts
export default async bud => {
  bud
    .proxy('http://0.0.0.0')
    .setPublicProxyUrl('http://example.lndo')

    .serve('http://0.0.0.0:3000')
    .setPublicUrl('http://example.lndo:3000') 
}
```

## âœ¨ feature(@roots/bud-vue): support typescript [#2075](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2075)

Adds automatic support for typescript in vue single file components. You only need to install [@roots/bud-typescript](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-typescript) and you should be good to go. [Adds an example to the examples directory](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/main/examples/vue-typescript) and integration tests to ensure this keeps working as the framework develops.

## âœ¨ feature(@roots/bud): improve bud cli [#2004](https://github.com/roots/bud/pull/2004)

Running `bud` (no subcommand) presents user with menu of common tasks to select from. `bud doctor` now displays additional information about the project.
