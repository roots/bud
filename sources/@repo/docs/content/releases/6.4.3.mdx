## ü©π fix: [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage) errors logged when not using tailwindcss

Errors no longer reported when not using tailwindcss in a [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage) project.

## ü©π fix: [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage) `bud.wpjson` doesn't generate colors

Colors now generated for `theme.json` when using `bud.wpjson.useTailwindColors()`

## ‚ú® feature: [@roots/bud-tailwindcss](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-tailwindcss) reference tailwindcss values in js files

You can now easily use tailwind theme values in your app code by importing them from the (virtual) `@tailwind/*` alias.

An example:

```ts
import {black} from '@tailwind/colors'
import {sans} from '@tailwind/fontFamily'

export const main = () => {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = black
  document.body.style.fontFamily = sans
}
```

Generating the imports can be memory intensive and increase build times, so it is opt-in.

```ts
app.tailwind.generateImports()
```

Better to generate imports only for specific keys (much less memory intensive):

```ts
app.tailwind.generateImports([`colors`, `fontFamily`])
```

This is a lot better than trying to import the actual `tailwind.config.js` file to read these values as the values are fully resolved (merged with `defaultTheme`, plugins applied, etc.)

And it's a lot better than importing `tailwindcss/resolveConfig` and doing it in the app code because of the transitive dependencies taken on by that import.

It's also better than pre-compiling a static json file because these values are tree-shakeable. The entire generated json for the default tailwind config is ~100kb.

The above example adds ~5kb to the overall bundle (and only because tailwind has so many default colors). If you use terser ([bud.minify](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.minimize)) the difference is entirely negligible.
