## ‚ú® [@roots/bud-preset-wordpress](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress): improve handling of `WP_HOME`

`WP_HOME` is now automatically set as a _fallback_ proxy value. This means that if you don't call [bud.proxy](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.proxy) value in your `bud.config.js` file, the extension will attempt to use `WP_HOME` (if it is available and is a string value).

Previously, this value was set up front, which could cause errors if the value was malformed.

## ü©π [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage): `bud.wpjson.useTailwindFontSize` mutates config

This function no longer mutates the tailwind config. This caused tailwind to not generate css for font sizes.

## ‚ú® [@roots/sage](https://bud.js.org/extensions/sage): filter theme.json values to those used in `theme.extend`

If you wish to limit generated values in `theme.json` to those included in `theme.extend`, you can now do so with an optional parameter passed to `useTailwindFontFamily`, `useTailwindColors`, and `useTailwindFontSize`.

```js
export default async bud => {
  /**
   * Limit generated values to those used in theme.extend
   */
  bud.wpjson.useTailwindFontFamily(true)
}
```

If called with no arguments, the default behavior is to generate all values resolved by tailwindcss.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è [@roots/bud-tailwindcss](https://bud.js.org/extensions/bud-tailwindcss): `bud.tailwindcss.resolveTailwindThemeValue` renamed to `bud.tailwindcss.resolveThemeValue`

This is an undocumented method but some of you may very well be using it. It's name changed.

## ü©π fix: `--browser` flag not working

Regression introduced in 6.4.0. Fixed (with added unit tests).
