## üëâüèº known issue: [@roots/sage] errors logged when not using tailwindcss

If you are not using `@roots/bud-tailwindcss` you will see errors in the logs when running `bud build` or `bud dev`.
This is a known issue and will be resolved in the next release. It isn't a sign that anything is wrong in your project.

## ‚ú® improve: [@roots/sage] `bud.wpjson` now fully resolves tailwind configs

Previously, `bud.wpjson` could only generate a `theme.json` based on a fully static tailwind config file. This excluded tailwind configs that
defined theme properties using functions and also meant that plugins would not be applied.

Now, `bud.wpjson` functions related to tailwindcss will fully resolve the tailwind config file and generate a `theme.json` based on the
processed config. This should mean that _any_ tailwind config can be used in conjunction with `bud.wpjson.useTailwindColors()` and similar functions.

## ü©π fix: build errors return non-zero exit code

For production builds, build errors will now result in a non-zero exit code. This regression was introduced in 6.4.0. It is now fixed.

## ü©π fix: eslint.config.js support

`eslint.config.js` configurations are now supported.

## ü©π fix: bud repl

The `bud repl` command has seen significant improvements since 6.4.0. It fixes a bug in 6.4.1 related to syntax highlighting.
