If you aren't trying to output esmodules with roots/sage, there is nothing critical in this release.

<!--truncate-->

## ðŸ©¹ Fix: chunk loading and formatting for es modules

We were missing a couple settings to enable fully modular output.

This can be pretty easily implemented in earlier versions:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.hooks.on('build.output', output => ({
  ...output,
  chunkFormat: 'module',
  chunkLoading: 'import',
}))
```

No reason to rush into this using this feature.

- Trellis users need to have [roots/trellis#1383](https://github.com/roots/trellis/commit/cc07d1e194d13f43b05c2a2bef162dfc6d87bc20) applied
  in order to serve the `.mjs` extension correctly.
- Sage users will also need to be running the latest `roots/acorn` version in order to properly enqueue the outputted modules.
