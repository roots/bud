<Callout.Component>
  Lightning fast frontend build tools combining the best parts of Symfony
  Encore and Laravel Mix.
</Callout.Component>

What Bud provides:

- a neat wrapper for Webpack and some associated build tools
- a friendly, chainable API to meet your configuration needs
- some battle-tested prefabs to help you stay focused on your application code

What Bud does not provide:

- **Out-of-the-box support for everything under the sun.** A fresh Bud install doesn't support sass, babel, react, etc.
  Instead, those things are installed from a [a rich library of first-party extensions](/extensions).

## Installation

See [installation instructions](/guides/installation).

## Getting started

If you don't know a lot about Webpack or don't feel fully comfortable with JavaScript,
check out the [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started). It was written with you in mind specifically.

## Working with the CLI

Check out the [bud cli guide](/guides/bud-cli/) for usage instructions.

## General usage guides

- [Configuring with TypeScript](/guides/general-use/config-ts)
- [Configuring with yml or json](/guides/general-use/config-static)
- [Environment specific configuration](/guides/general-use/config-env)
- [Running multiple compilers](/guides/general-use/multi-compiler)
- [Using as a node library](/guides/advanced-use/node)

## Configuration function reference

Common `bud.config.js` functions are all detailed [in their own docs](/docs). It is also a great resource to skim if you're
trying to figure out what all **bud** can do.

## Extensions repository

In bud most features are opt-in and provided via installable extensions. You may be interested in scoping out
the [list of extensions and their documented uses](/extensions).

## Blog

Lastly, [check out our blog](/blog) for release announcements and maintainer notes.
