**bud.js** is a web-focused build tool with add-on support for Babel, React, PostCSS, Sass, Typescript, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, and more.

The standard bud.js compiler leverages webpack, but is open to being extended to support other build tools.

bud.js is written in TypeScript but fully supports projects written in vanilla JavaScript.

## Requirements

<div className="card">
  <div className="card__body">
    <ul>
      <li>node 16+</li>
      <li>yarn 1.22 or higher</li>
      <li>npm 8.3 or higher</li>
      <li>Windows users must use Windows Subsystem for Linux</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Installation

Add **@roots/bud** as a development dependency using your choice of package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud --save-dev
```

When installing extensions make sure that the extension version is compatible with bud core. In general, all dependencies with the `@roots` namespace should share the same version.
