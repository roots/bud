## Installation

Add **@roots/bud** as a development dependency using your choice of package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud --save-dev
```

## Usage

If your project's entrypoint is located at `./src/index.(js|css)` you can now compile it using the [bud build](./cli/build/index.mdx) command.
No configuration is required. The bundled code will be output to `./dist/main.(js|css)`.

For information on customizing the build for your application see the [configuration basics](configure) guide.

## Adding features

**bud.js** is built modularly. This means features can be added as needed by adding extensions to your project.

The [configuration basics](configure) guide has more information on how to add extensions, but most of them start and end with installing a package.

For example, you can add babel and postcss support by
installing [@roots/bud-babel](/extensions/bud-babel) and [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss/):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-babel @roots/bud-postcss --save-dev
```

Consult the [extensions directory](/extensions/) for available first-party extensions.

## Upgrading bud.js

In general, all dependencies with the `@roots/*` namespace should share the same version.

To make it easy to keep versions in sync you can use the [bud upgrade](./cli/index.mdx) command.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run bud upgrade
```
