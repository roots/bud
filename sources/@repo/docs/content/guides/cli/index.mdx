The `bud` command is your primary means of interfacing with the **bud** framework.

To explore what all is available to you, use `bud help`. You can also learn about any subcommand using the `--help` flag.

Extensions may register additional commands which are not reflected here.

<CodeBlock title="$ bud help">{Help}</CodeBlock>

## TypeScript binary

When using a configuring authored in TypeScript, you will need to either:

- use the `ts-bud` command in place of `bud`
- use [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) to execute the `bud` CLI bin
