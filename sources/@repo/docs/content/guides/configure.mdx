This is a very light touch overview of some of the most common ways users will interact with bud.js.

## Creating a bud config file

Most users will configure **bud.js** using a dynamic configuration file. This file can be placed either in project root or a subdirectory named `config`.

To use `import`/`export` syntax and take advantage of ESM-only packages, we recommend using the `.mjs` extension. The documentation on this site assumes users are using modular JavaScript.

The fundamentals:

- The config file is **not** required.
- The config file must include `bud.config` in the filename.
- The file exports a single function which receives an instance of **bud**.
- The function can be `async`.
- The function is expected to be the default export.
- The function does not need to return anything.

### An example config

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
// @ts-check

/**
 * Build configuration for bud.js
 * @param bud {import('@roots/bud').Bud}
 */
export default async bud => {
  /**
   * The bud instance
   */
  bud
    /**
     * Set the project source directory
     */
    .setPath(`@src`, `sources`)

    /**
     * Set the application entrypoints
     * These paths are expressed relative to the `@src` directory
     */
    .entry({
      app: [`app.js`, `app.css`], // [`./sources/app.js`, `./sources/app.css`]
    })

    /**
     * Copy static assets from `sources/static` to `dist/static`
     */
    .assets({
      from: bud.path(`@src/static`),
      to: bud.path(`@dist/static`),
    })
}
```

Most config functions in bud are designed to be chained, like you see above. However, this is optional, and there is nothing wrong with not doing it.

## Project paths

### Setting application paths

[bud.setPath](/docs/bud.setPath) is used to set project source and output paths.

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  /* Set the source path.*/
  bud.setPath('@src', 'source')
  /* Set the output path.*/
  bud.setPath('@dist', 'build')
}
```

The `@src` and `@dist` handles are special handles associated with the input and output base directories.

### Referencing application paths

Once set, paths can be referenced using [bud.path](/docs/bud.path).

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.path('@src') // absolute path to app source
  bud.path('@dist') // absolute path to app output
}
```

### Reserved paths

**bud.js** has a few path handles which fulfill a special role. We've already seen two of them:

| handle       | description           | default        |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **@src**     | input directory       | `src`          |
| **@dist**    | output directory      | `dist`         |
| **@storage** | cache/build artifacts | `.budfiles`    |
| **@modules** | modules directory     | `node_modules` |

These paths can be overridden but should not be removed or hijacked for something unrelated to what is described

### Globbing

[bud.glob](/docs/bud.glob) is a built-in globbing utility that can be used to generate a list of files matching a given pattern.

This function is asychronous (returns a promise) and can be used in conjunction with `await`.

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  await bud.glob('@src', '**/*.js') // returns an array of absolute paths
}
```

There is a synchronous version available as well: [bud.globSync](/docs/bud.globSync).

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.globSync('@src', '**/*.js') // returns an array of absolute paths
}
```

## Managing assets

### Application entrypoints

Bud uses the concept of "entrypoints" to group application scripts and styles. Entrypoints are defined using [bud.entry](/docs/bud.entry).

You can think of an entrypoint as a "page" in your application. Each entrypoint will have its own output file.

If you only have a single entrypoint then it is enough to just pass the filename:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry('app') // src/app.js
}
```

If you have more than one file to include in the bundle, you can use an array:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry(['app.js', 'global.css'])
}
```

If you have additional entrypoints you may call [bud.entry](/docs/bud.entry) multiple times.

But, it might be preferable to use an object:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry({
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css'],
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css'],
  })
}
```

There is still more that this function can do, but for our overview this is more than enough. You can learn more about this and
other details in the [bud.entry documentation](/docs/bud.entry).

### Static assets

The [bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) function is used to copy static assets to the output directory.

The simplest way to use it is to pass an array of directories (relative to [your project `@src` directory](#project-paths)) you would like to copy:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
}
```

If you want more control over the directory being output to, you can use an array of from/to pairs:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets([
    ['images', 'assets/images'], // from `@src/images` to `@dist/assets/images`
    ['fonts', 'assets/fonts'], // from `@src/fonts` to `@dist/assets/fonts`
  ])
}
```

For complete control, you can pass an object:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets({
    from: bud.path(`@src`, 'images'),
    to: bud.path(`@dist`, 'images', `@name`), // `@name` is the filename (including hash if applicable)
    context: bud.path(`@src`),
    noErrorOnMissing: true,
    toType: `template`,
  })
```

:::info No need to copy imported assets

If you are already including assets by importing them in a script or stylesheet, you do not need
to call [bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) on them as well. For example, running [bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) on
`@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2` would be unnecessary:

```js title='index.css'
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src: url(@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2) format('woff2');
}
```

:::

You can learn more about this and other details in the [bud.assets documentation](/docs/bud.assets).

## Optimizing

There are a number of optional optimizations you can perform on your application.

### File hashing

Use the [bud.hash](/docs/bud.hash) function to generate a hash for each file in the bundle. This hash will be added to outputted files.

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.hash()
}
```

### Minimizing code

Use the [bud.minimize](/docs/bud.minimize) function to run your application code through a minifier.

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.minimize()
}
```

### Creating a runtime

You may create an application runtime using [bud.runtime](/docs/bud.runtime). Using the `single` option is probably
the simplest and best solution for most applications:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.runtime('single')
}
```

### Creating a vendor chunk

You can perform general code splitting with [bud.splitChunks](/docs/bud.splitChunks).

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.splitChunks()
}
```

## Overriding the generated configuration

At the end of the day, you may find yourself needing to override the config. You may do so using the **bud.override** function.

The most versatile way to do this is using a calback function:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.config(config => ({
    ...config,
    output: {
      ...config.output,
      filename: 'scripts/[name].js',
    },
  }))
}
```

## Adding extensions

**bud.js** is designed to be extended. Extensions which are downloaded as packages should be automatically instantiated and registered
along with **bud.js**. So, if you want to use React, you can simply install [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react) and your project will be ready to use JSX.

If you want to add your own extensions after **bud.js** has bootstrapped, you can do so using [bud.use](/docs/bud.use).

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
import {BudExtension} from './extensions'

export default async bud => {
  bud.use([BudExtension])
}
```

## Adding Webpack plugins

In addition to supporting ad-hoc extensions, [bud.use](/docs/bud.use) supports any off-the-shelf webpack plugin:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
import WebpackBar from 'webpackbar'

export default async bud => {
  bud.use([new WebpackBar()])
}
```

## Running the build

Once you have configured your project the simplest way to actually run the compiler it is using the `bud build` command:

### In production

```bash npm2yarn
yarn bud build production
```

### In development

```bash npm2yarn
yarn bud build development
```

`ctrl+c` will terminate the application when running in `development` mode.
