## Application entrypoints

Bud uses the concept of "entrypoints" to group application scripts and styles. Entrypoints are defined using [bud.entry](/docs/bud.entry).

You can think of an entrypoint as a "page" in your application. Each entrypoint will have its own output file.

If you only have a single entrypoint then it is enough to just pass the filename:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry('app') // src/app.js
}
```

If you have more than one file to include in the bundle, you can use an array:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry(['app.js', 'global.css'])
}
```

If you have additional entrypoints you may call [bud.entry](/docs/bud.entry) multiple times.

But, it might be preferable to use an object:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.entry({
    app: ['app.js', 'global.css'],
    landing: ['landing.js', 'landing.css'],
  })
}
```

There is still more that this function can do, but for our overview this is more than enough. You can learn more about this and
other details in the [bud.entry documentation](/docs/bud.entry).

## Copying static assets

The [bud.assets](/docs/bud.assets) function is used to copy files to the output directory.

The simplest way to use it is to pass an array of directories (relative to [your project `@src` directory](#project-paths)) you would like to copy:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets(['images', 'fonts'])
}
```

If you want more control over the directory being output to, you can use an array of from/to pairs:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets([
    ['images', 'assets/images'], // from `@src/images` to `@dist/assets/images`
    ['fonts', 'assets/fonts'], // from `@src/fonts` to `@dist/assets/fonts`
  ])
}
```

For complete control, you can pass an object:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
export default async bud => {
  bud.assets({
    from: bud.path(`@src`, 'images'),
    to: bud.path(`@dist`, 'images', `@name`), // `@name` is the filename (including hash if applicable)
    context: bud.path(`@src`),
    noErrorOnMissing: true,
    toType: `template`,
  })
```

:::info No need to copy imported assets

If you are already including assets by importing them in a script or stylesheet, you do not need
to copy them explicitly. For example, given this stylesheet, copying `@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2` would be unnecessary:

```js title='index.css'
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src: url(@src/fonts/MyFont.woff2) format('woff2');
}
```
