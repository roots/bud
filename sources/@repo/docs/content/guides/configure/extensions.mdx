## Adding extensions

**bud.js** is designed to be extended. Extensions which are downloaded as packages should be automatically instantiated and registered
along with **bud.js**. So, if you want to use React, you can simply install [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react) and your project will be ready to use JSX.

If you want to add your own extensions after **bud.js** has bootstrapped, you can do so using [bud.use](/docs/bud.use).

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
import {BudExtension} from './extensions'

export default async bud => {
  bud.use([BudExtension])
}
```

## Adding Webpack plugins

In addition to supporting ad-hoc extensions, [bud.use](/docs/bud.use) supports any off-the-shelf webpack plugin:

```js title='bud.config.mjs'
import WebpackBar from 'webpackbar'

export default async bud => {
  bud.use([new WebpackBar()])
}
```
