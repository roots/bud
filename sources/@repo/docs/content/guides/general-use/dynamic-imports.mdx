import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

Dynamic imports are a great way to keep bundle size minimal for users. A dynamic import looks like this:

```ts
export const caller = async () => {
  const component = await import('./component')
  component.doThing()
}
```

**bud.js** fully supports dynamic imports. However, if you are serving assets from a non-root URL, you will need to [to set the public path](/docs/bud.setPublicPath).

## Setting with bud.setPublicPath

The most straight-forward way to set it is using [bud.setPublicPath](/docs/bud.setPublicPath).

Example for [@roots/sage](/extensions/sage) users:

```ts
bud.setPublicPath('/app/themes/sage/public/')
```

## Setting with bud.entry

You may also set the public path using [bud.entry](/docs/bud.entry):

```ts
bud.entry({
  app: {
    import: ['@src/app.js', '@src/app.css'],
    publicPath: '/app/themes/sage/public/',
  },
})
```

## Setting with envvar

If you set the `APP_PUBLIC_PATH` envvar you don't need to call anything in `bud.config.js`. It will be set for your automatically.
