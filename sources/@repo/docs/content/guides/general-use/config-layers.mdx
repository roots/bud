It is possible to create more than one bud configuration file. Each configuration file is applied
in the following order:

1. `bud.config` - the standard, base configuration. always applied.
2. `bud.config.local` - the local configuration. always applied.
3. `bud.config.${mode}` - the mode-specific configuration. applied if the mode matches.
4. `bud.config.${mode}.local` - the mode-specific local configuration. applied if the mode matches.
