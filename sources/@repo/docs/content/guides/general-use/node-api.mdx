import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

**bud.js** can be imported and instantiated directly instead of being run through the CLI.

## Instantiating **bud.js**

### Using `get`

The fastest way to get ahold of a `bud` instance is calling the `get` helper exported from **@roots/bud/factory**.

```ts title='config/build.mts'
import type {Bud} from '@roots/bud'
import {get} from '@roots/bud/factory'

const basdir = process.cwd()
const bud: Bud = await get(basedir)
```

If `get` is called again with the same `basedir` it will return the same instance. This means that you can arbitrarily access `bud` from anywhere in your project
and have assurance you're working with the same instance.

### Using `@roots/bud/factory`

The fastest way to get going is calling the `factory` helper exported from **@roots/bud/factory**.

```ts title='config/build.mts'
import type {Bud} from '@roots/bud'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud/factory'

const bud: Bud = await factory()
```

### Manually

You'll need to create an application context and pass it to the `Bud` `lifecyle` method.

```ts title='config/build.mts'
import Bud from '@roots/bud'
import * as applicationContext from '@roots/bud/context'

const context = await applicationContext.get(process.cwd())

// override context options here

const bud: Bud = await new Bud().lifecycle(context)

// configure build here

await bud.run()
```

## Application context

The application context is a collection of options used to bootstrap the bud instance.

| Option     | Description                       | Optional |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| label      | application identifier            | no       |
| basedir    | application root directory        | yes      |
| manifest   | application package.json contents | yes      |
| mode       | `production` or `development`     | yes      |
| args       | cli args                          | yes      |
| config     | application configuration files   | yes      |
| extensions | array of extension signifiers     | yes      |
| services   | array of service signifiers       | yes      |
| env        | Env key/value records             | yes      |
| stdin      | Writable stream                   | yes      |
| stdout     | Writable stream                   | yes      |
| stderr     | Writable stream                   | yes      |
| colorDepth | Color depth, number               | yes      |

### Creating application context

Same as in the [manual instantiation example above](#manually):

```ts title='config/build.mts'
import * as applicationContext from '@roots/bud/context'
const context = await applicationContext.get(process.cwd())
```

Like the `get` export from `@roots/bud/factory`, `applicationContext.get` will return the same context for the same basedir if called more than once.

### Overridding context values

You may pass overrides to `factory`. Example:

```ts title='config/build.mts'
import type {Bud} from '@roots/bud'
import type {Overrides} from '@roots/bud-framework/options'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud/factory'

const overrides: Overrides = {
  label: `app-build`,
  basedir: process.cwd(),
  mode: `production`,
  args: {
    discover: false,
    dry: true,
  },
  env: {
    SOME_SECRET_KEY: `some-secret-value`,
  },
}

const bud: Bud = await factory(overrides)
```
