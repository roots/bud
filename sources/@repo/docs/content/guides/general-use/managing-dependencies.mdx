From the yarn docs:

> If your package is a meta-package of utilities [...], the situation is a bit complicated and you have two different options:
>
> - The preferred one is to list the dependency [...] as both a regular dependency and a peer dependency. Yarn will interpret this pattern as "peer dependency with a default", meaning that your users will be able to take ownership of the Webpack package if they need to, while still giving the package manager the ability to emit a warning if the provided version is incompatible with the one your package expects.

bud.js extensions usually come with everything you need to use a particular tool in your application. But, sometimes your application's needs will be in conflict with the defaults that ship with bud.js.

A common example of this is Vue 2 vs Vue 3. **@roots/bud-vue** supports Vue 3 by default, but if you need/want to use Vue 2, you can. You'll just need to override some of the peer dependencies in order to do so.

Likewise, in **@roots/bud-tailwindcss** we will update TailwindCSS when it is safe to do so. If there is a version mismatch between TailwindCSS and something in postcss-preset-env, you'll need to override the version of TailwindCSS in your project in order to use the latest version. Once the conflict is resolved, we'll do the same.

:::info Be careful

Once you start overriding dependencies, you're on your own. It's hard enough to manage dependencies in a single project, let alone a monorepo, so our bandwidth to help will be limited.

## Overriding peer dependencies

There isn't an API to manage dependency overrides per se, we just use the peer dependency features built into npm and yarn to make it possible for you to customize your dependencies as needed. To do so you will just install the needed overrides in your project.

Nearly all of the popular dependencies listed by bud.js and its extensions (vue, react, tailwindcss, typescript, swc, et al) are listed as peer dependencies. Their accepted versions are all very loose.

## In practice

A Vue 3 project can just install **@roots/bud** and **@roots/bud-vue** and everything should be perfectly set up. But, at least for now, in order to use Vue 2, you'll need to override:

- vue (^2.6.14)
- vue-template-compiler (^2.6.14)
- vue-loader (^15.9.4)

Once installed **@roots/bud-vue** will recognize the version of vue you've installed is for Vue 2 and will configure the project accordingly.

```ts
class BudVueExtension {
  // ...
  /**
   * Returns true if user has installed a 2.x.x version of vue
   *
   * @public
   * @decorator `@bind`
   */
  @bind
  protected async isVue2() {
    const manifest = await this.app.module.readManifest(`vue`)
    this.logger.log(`vue manifest:`, manifest)
    return parseSemver(`vue@${manifest.version}`).version.startsWith(`2`)
  }
}
```
