:::info Experimental

This feature is flagged by webpack as **experimental** and, as such, it is opt-in.

If you use this feature and bump into a problem please ensure that
**bud.js** is doing something wrong before opening an issue in the roots/bud repository. Consider accompanying your issue with
a PR that implements the change you would like to see.

:::

You can build remote packages at compile time, serve them locally, and generate a lockfile to guarantee deployed dependencies match your development environment.

Ships with following sources, but you can add more:

- `skypack`
- `gist`
- `github`
- `unpkg`

## Import mapping

Use any registered source as a key in `package.json` to map imports to it. It can be done with either an object or an array:

```json title="package.json"
"skypack": [
  "alpinejs"
]
```

```json title="package.json"
"skypack": {
  "alpinejs": "3.10.0"
}
```

If the CDN supports it you can pass params in addition to the version:

```json title="package.json"
"skypack": {
  "alpinejs": "latest?dist=es2015"
}
```

Once set you can import from `'alpinejs'` anywhere in your application source and the remote source will be compiled with it (as if the module were local).

## `[source]:` schema

It isn't required to set up an import map to bring in a module. You can also import from a registered remote using its schema:

```ts title="app.js"
import lodash from 'skypack:lodash'
import Gist from 'gist:kellymears/a9ab48c40a6f757a8814301e2dea7582/raw/55807c18a2e84246f99486f385dcf2e8ec07e0e9/module-import-test.js'
import Confetti from 'github:catdad/canvas-confetti/master/src/confetti.js'
import * as preact from 'unpkg:preact'
```

## Setting custom sources

You can add your own sources

```ts title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.cdn.setSource('localhost', 'https://localhost:8080/')
```

If you want to remove a source it's easy to access the mapping directly:

```ts title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.cdn.sources.delete('gist')
```

## Module caching

Modules are by default cached to `.budfiles/[compiler name]/modules/[source ident]/[module]`. This means that after the initial download you won't need to hit up the CDN again.

To disable this behavior use `cdn.disableCache()`.

## Module versioning

The current version & an SHA512 of the remote resource is stored at `.budfiles/[compiler name]/bud.lock`.

Module versions are updated and a new source is cached when the remote changes, by default. To disable this behavior try `bud.cdn.setUpgrade(false)`.

You can prevent version upgrades during deployment with the `--immutable` flag or by calling `cdn.freeze()`. If you use this feature you must include the lockfile and module cache in version control. The build will obviously fail if the lockfile/cache is set as frozen but is not available.

## URL imports from ESM

If [outputting esmodules](/guides/general-use/esmodules) packages can be listed in the `imports` field of `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "imports": {
    "alpinejs": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/alpinejs",
    "animejs": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/animejs",
    "axios": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/axios"
  }
}
```

Imports of these packages will be resolved to the specified URL. This structure
allows you to use es modules without touching application code.

```ts title="app.ts"
import Alpine from 'alpinejs' // resolves to `https://cdn.skypack.dev/alpinejs`

window.Alpine = Alpine
```

For this to work correctly, ensure that `type="module"` is set on the `<script>` tag.

Outputted scripts will be emitted with the `.mjs` extension.
