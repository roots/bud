import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

Compile remote modules as if they were local. Import code from a gist or transpile a single module from a beta branch of a github repo. Import modules for fun and/or profit from `skypack` or `unpkg`.

Ships with following sources:

- `skypack`
- `gist`
- `github`
- `unpkg`

## Import mapping

Use any registered source as a key in `package.json` to map imports to it. It can be done with either an object or an array:

```json
"skypack": [
  "alpinejs"
]
```

```json
"skypack": {
  "alpinejs": "3.10.0"
}
```

If the CDN supports it you can pass params in addition to the version:

```json
"skypack": {
  "alpinejs": "latest?dist=es2015"
}
```

Once set you can import from `'alpinejs'` anywhere in your application source and the remote source will be compiled with it (as if the module were local).

## `[source]:` schema

It isn't required to set up an import map to bring in a module. You can also import from a registered remote using its schema:

```ts
import lodash from 'skypack:lodash'
import Gist from 'gist:kellymears/a9ab48c40a6f757a8814301e2dea7582/raw/55807c18a2e84246f99486f385dcf2e8ec07e0e9/module-import-test.js'
import Confetti from 'github:catdad/canvas-confetti/master/src/confetti.js'
import * as preact from 'unpkg:preact'
```

## Setting custom sources

You can add your own sources

```ts
app.cdn.setSource('localhost', 'https://localhost:8080/')
```

If you want to remove a source it's easy to access the mapping directly:

```ts
app.cdn.sources.delete('gist')
```

## Module caching

Modules are by default cached to `.budfiles/[compiler name]/modules/[source ident]/[module]`. This means that after the initial download you won't need to hit up the CDN again.

To disable this behavior use `cdn.disableCache()`.

## Module versioning

The current version & an SHA512 of the remote resource is stored at `.budfiles/[compiler name]/bud.lock`.

Module versions are updated and a new source is cached when the remote changes, by default. To disable this behavior try `bud.cdn.setUpgrade(false)`.

You can prevent version upgrades during deployment with the `--immutable` flag or by calling `cdn.freeze()`. If you use this feature you must include the lockfile and module cache in version control. The build will obviously fail if the lockfile/cache is set as frozen but is not available.
