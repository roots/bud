By default, **bud.js** only resolves source code from [the `@src` directory](/docs/bud.path).

Nearly all of the modules you install will be transpiled before they are published. It's almost always a waste to run this code through Babel or whatever other transpiler you may be using.

Nevertheless, some packages expect to be transpiled from source. We can allow for this with the **bud.build.rules** API.

Common examples:

- `highlight.js`
- various `scss` frameworks
- a project that needs to source modules from multiple directories

## Adding sources

You should make modifications to transpiler sources within a `config.after` action.
Some extensions will not register build rules until after the config file is processed;
using this hook will guarantee that your customization takes precedence.

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`config.after`, async bud => {
  bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
    bud => bud.path('@src'),
    bud => bud.path('@modules/some-untranspiled-pkg'),
  ])
})
```

:::info

`@modules` is a [bud.path](/docs/bud.path) built-in handle referencing `node_modules`

:::

Or, you can be broad:

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`config.after`, async bud => {
  bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
    bud => bud.path('@src'),
    bud => bud.path('@modules'),
  ])
})
```

To be maximally accepting of what you want to transpile, you can use the following snippet:

```ts
bud.hooks.action(`config.after`, async bud => {
  Object.values(bud.build.rules).map(rule =>
    rule.setInclude([
      bud => bud.path('@src'),
      bud => bud.path('@modules'),
    ]),
  )
})
```

In general, we would advise being as restrictive as possible when it comes to whitelisting transpiler sources.
