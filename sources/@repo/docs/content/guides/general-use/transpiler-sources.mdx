**bud.js** only resolves source code from [the `@src` directory](/guides/general-use/pathing).

Nearly all of the modules you install will be transpiled before they are published. It's almost always a waste to run this code through Babel or whatever other transpiler you may be using.

Nevertheless, some packages expect you to transpile their code as part of your build process. We can do this by updating the matching rule.

## Adding sources

You can be specific about what you want to include for transpilation with something like the following:

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
  bud => bud.path('@src'),
  bud => bud.path('@modules/some-untranspiled-pkg'),
])
```

Or, you can be broad:

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
  bud => bud.path('@src'),
  bud => bud.path('@modules'),
])
```

## Restricting sources

You can also do the opposite and _restrict_ transpiler sources.

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setExclude([bud => bud.path('@src')])
```

You may use `setInclude` and `setExclude` together.
