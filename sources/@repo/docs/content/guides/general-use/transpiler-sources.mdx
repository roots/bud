By default, **bud.js** only resolves source code from [the `@src` directory](/docs/bud.path).

Nearly all of the modules you install will be transpiled before they are published. It's almost always a waste to run this code through Babel or whatever other transpiler you may be using.

Nevertheless, some packages expect to be transpiled from source. We can allow for this with the **bud.build.rules** API.

Common examples:

- `highlight.js`
- various `scss` frameworks

## Adding sources

You can be specific about what you want to include for transpilation with something like the following:

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
  bud => bud.path('@src'),
  bud => bud.path('@modules/some-untranspiled-pkg'),
])
```

Or, you can be broad:

```ts
bud.build.rules.js.setInclude([
  bud => bud.path('@src'),
  bud => bud.path('@modules'),
])
```

To be maximally accepting of what you want to transpile, you can use the following snippet:

```ts
Object.values(bud.build.rules).map(rule =>
  rule.setInclude([bud => bud.path('@src'), bud => bud.path('@modules')]),
)
```

In general, we would advise being as restrictive as possible when it comes to whitelisting transpiler sources.
