:::info Experimental feature

This is a newer feature of bud.js. It is possible that this API will change in future releases. We suspect these changes will
be driven by the needs of users.

:::

It is possible to configure more than one Webpack compiler from a single bud config file.

For a single page app this isn't really that useful. However, for WordPress or a Symfony app &mdash; anything with very different
needs for its marketing pages and administrative interfaces &mdash; it is potentially very useful.

## In practice

To specify a new child instance, we can use [bud.make](/docs/bud.make). It is a function that accepts two parameters: a name for the instance
(so we can refer to it later), and a callback that is identical to the standard `bud.config.js` module-level function.

In this example we're creating two instances of bud: one for `theme` code and another for `plugin` code.

<Tabs
  groupId="lang"
  defaultValue="ts"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="js">

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = app =>
  app
    .make('theme', theme =>
      theme
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
        .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css']),
    )
    .make('plugin', plugin =>
      plugin
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/plugin')
        .entry('plugin', ['plugin.js', 'plugin.css']),
    )
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ts">

```ts title='bud.config.ts'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'

export default (app: Framework): void =>
  app
    .make('theme', (theme: Framework): void => {
      theme
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
        .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css'])
    })
    .make('plugin', (plugin: Framework): void =>
      plugin
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/plugin')
        .entry('plugin', ['plugin.js', 'plugin.css']),
    )
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using the `--target` flag

The other benefit is a potentially massive workflow improvement. Let's say that we have to work on the `theme` more often than the `plugin`.
With the above config we don't have to rebuild the `plugin` code again just to work on our `theme` code.

We can use the `bud` cli to only run the compiler we need using [the `--target` flag](/guides/bud-cli/build).

```sh
$ yarn bud build --target theme
```

If you had more than two instances it might make sense to want to target more than one compiler, and `--target` supports that:

```sh
$ yarn bud build --target theme --target plugin
```

## Compilers can only be made from the parent context

You cannot create a child compiler from a child compiler. So, don't do this:

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = app =>
  app.make('theme', theme => {
    theme
      .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
      .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css'])

      .make('invalid', grandchild => {
        /**
         * `theme` cannot create a child compiler. only `app` can.
         */
      })
  })
```

If you want to create another child compiler, do so from the parent context:

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = app =>
  app
    .make('theme', theme => {
      theme
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
        .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css'])
    })
    .make('plugin', plugin => {
      plugin
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/plugin')
        .entry('plugin', ['plugin.js', 'plugin.css'])
    })
```
