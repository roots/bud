This feature is flagged by webpack as **experimental** and, as such, it is opt-in.

If you use this feature and bump into a problem please ensure that
**bud.js** is doing something wrong before opening an issue in the roots/bud repository. Consider accompanying your issue with
a PR that implements the change you would like to see.

:::

To output `esm`, you may call:

```ts
app.esm.enable()
```

Or, set the `build` command's `--esm` flag:

```sh
bud build --esm
```

Once set packages can be listed in the `imports` field of `package.json`:

```json
{
  // ...

  "imports": {
    "alpinejs": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/alpinejs",
    "animejs": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/animejs",
    "axios": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/axios"
  }
}
```

Imports of these packages will be resolved to the specified URL. This structure
allows you to use es modules without touching application code.

```ts title="app.ts"
import Alpine from 'alpinejs' // resolves to `https://cdn.skypack.dev/alpinejs`

window.Alpine = Alpine
```

For this to work correctly, ensure that `type="module"` is set on the `<script>` tag.

Outputted scripts will be emitted with the `.mjs` extension.
