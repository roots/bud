:::info Experimental

pnpm compatibility is a work-in-progress.

:::

We are working towards seamless compatibility with package managers utilizing alternative module resolution strategies like pnpm and yarn pnp. For now you will need to take a few extra steps.

## Installation

If you are using pnpm you will need to add `--public-hoist-pattern=*` to the instalation command.

```
pnpm install --public-hoist-pattern=*
```

bud.js largely relies on [module hoisting](https://maier.tech/posts/a-guide-to-understanding-how-yarn-hoists-dependencies-and-handles-conflicting-packages). This is not the default behavior for pnpm.

## .pnpmfile.cjs compatibilty shim

In addition to using the `public-hoist-pattern` flag, you will want to add the following `.pnpmfile.cjs` to your project root. If you have already ran an installation you will need to clear your
lockfiles and `node_modules` in order for the shim to take effect.

All bud.js modules come with batteries included but allow for overriding built-in dependencies with custom versions. However, this approach is in conflict with pnpm, which does not install peerDependencies marked as optional.
The pnpm install hook removes peerDependencies from `@roots/*` packages unless they are listed specifically in the project `package.json`. This rectifies the issue.

```typescript title=.pnpmfile.cjs
const {dependencies, devDependencies} = require(`./package.json`)

/**
 * bud.js pnpm compatibility shim
 *
 * pnpm allows customizing the package installation process through special functions called hooks.
 * These hooks can be defined in a .pnpmfile.cjs file, which should be located in the same directory
 * as the lockfile. For example, in a monorepo with a shared lockfile, the .pnpmfile.cjs file should
 * be placed in the root of the monorepo.
 *
 * @see {@link https://pnpm.io/pnpmfile} for more information on pnpmfile
 */
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    /**
     * This hook removes peerDependencies from @roots/* packages because
     * pnpm does not install peerDependencies marked as optional by default.
     * This behavior differs from npm and yarn, which install peerDependencies
     * even if they are marked as optional.
     */
    readPackage(data) {
      // Skip processing if the package is not a @roots/* package
      if (!data.name.startsWith(`@roots`)) return data

      // Skip processing if the package does not have peerDependencies
      if (!data.peerDependencies) return data

      // Filter out peerDependencies that are already listed as dependencies or devDependencies
      const peerDependencies = Object.entries(data.peerDependencies)
        .filter(
          ([signifier]) =>
            Object.keys(dependencies || {}).includes(signifier) ||
            Object.keys(devDependencies || {}).includes(signifier),
        )
        .reduce(
          (peerDependencies, [signifier, version]) => ({
            ...peerDependencies,
            [signifier]: version,
          }),
          {},
        )

      // Return the package data with the filtered peerDependencies
      // and an empty peerDependenciesMeta object
      return Object.assign(data, {
        peerDependencies,
        peerDependenciesMeta: {},
      })
    },
  },
}
```
