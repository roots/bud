Most of the first party **bud.js** extensions expose a friendly API to use when configuring your build.
But, there is also a more direct way to interact with them which you may find useful:

## Get an extension reference

You may get an extension instance with `bud.extensions.get`:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions.get('copy-webpack-plugin')
```

From there you can do a lot of different things:

## Enable or disable an extension

Call `enable` to enable an extension:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions.get('webpack-clean-plugin').enable()
```

Or `disable` to disable it:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions.get('webpack-clean-plugin').disable()
```

## Set options

Call `setOptions` to set any registered `options` directly:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions.get('copy-webpack-plugin').setOptions({
  patterns: [{from: bud.path('@src/images')}],
})
```

`setOptions` also takes a callback which is passed the current options:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions.get('copy-webpack-plugin').setOptions(options => ({
  ...options,
  patterns: [{from: bud.path('@src/images')}],
}))
```

## Set an option

Call `setOption` if you only need to set a single option and don't want to have to handle
merging existing options:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions
  .get('copy-webpack-plugin')
  .setOption('patterns', [{from: bud.path('@src/images')}])
```

Like `setOptions`, you can also utilize a callback here:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.extensions
  .get('copy-webpack-plugin')
  .setOption('patterns', patterns => [
    ...patterns,
    {from: bud.path('@src/images')},
  ])
```

## Register an extension

Extensions included in `package.json` are automatically instantiated. You can also add extensions using [`bud.use`](/docs/bud.use).
But, again, you can choose to use the bud extensions API directly in order to register an extension, if desired:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
const Plugin = require('some-webpack-plugin')
await bud.extensions.add(new Plugin())
```

**bud.js extensions are a superset of Webpack plugins**.
This means that you can add basically any Webpack plugin as demonstrated above.
