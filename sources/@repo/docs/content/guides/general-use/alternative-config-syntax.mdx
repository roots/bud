import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import YML from '!!raw-loader!@site/../../../examples/config-yml/bud.config.yml'

In addition to `.js`, `.cjs` and `.mjs` configurations, **bud.js** supports configuration files authored with json5 and yml.

[TypeScript support is relatively easy to add.](#typescript)

## YML

For instance, the equivalent of the following JS configuration:

```js
bud.entry('app', 'app.js')
```

Would be:

```yml
entry: ['app', 'app.js']
```

There is some flexibility here if you are passing a single value and it is NOT an array. So, this is okay:

```yml
entry:
  app: app.js
```

But, this would cause an error. it will be parsed as if it were a multi-parameter call:

```yml
# This is incorrect
assets: ['src/**/*.html', 'app/**/*.html']
```

You can access nested properties no problem.

```yml
babel:
  setPluginOptions:
    - '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime'
    - {helpers: true}
```

### Referencing bud values

You can make reference to the `bud` object with `_bud`.

```yml
splitChunks: _bud.isProduction
```

You can tap `bud` with an arrow fn if needed. These functions will be called
as they are encountered and supplied with the bud instance.

```yml
minimize: bud => bud.isProduction
```

### Treating a value as a function

You can prefix a string with `=>` to indicate that it should be treated as a function. These functions will be called
as they are encountered.

This will log `4`:

```yml
log: => 2 + 2
```

### Handling callbacks

Some functions accept functions as a value. In cases like these wrap the function in an additional `=>` so that the
config parser does not call the function itself.

```yml
webpackConfig: >
  => config => ({...config, parallelism: 1})
```

[bud.tap](/docs/bud.tap) and [bud.tapAsync](/docs/bud.tapAsync) can be helpful for dynamic configuration and work like this:

```yml
tap: >
  => bud => {
    // this is a very flexible
    // area to do all sorts of dynamic config stuff
    bud.log('hi!')
  }

tapAsync: >
  => async bud => {
    // same as above but async
    bud.log('hi!', '...eventually')
  }
```

If you're doing a lot of this remember that you can create JS configurations in addition to the yml one.

## JSON

JSON works by the same rules as yml and you can use json5 syntax (comments, non-quoted keys).

```json
{
  entry: ['app', ['app.js']],
  runtime: [true],
  assets: [['src/**/*.html']],
  babel: {
    setPluginOptions: [
      "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime",
      {helpers: false, regenerator: false},
    ],
  },
}
```

If you are doing a lot of dynamic configuration you may find it easier to use YML or JS. Ultimately, it's your choice, but
we recommend using yml over json for more complicated configs.

## TypeScript

You can use TypeScript to configure your build. In general we would recommend using JavaScript with typedoc comments, but TypeScript is supported.

### ts-bud

When configuring bud.js with TypeScript you must use `ts-bud` rather than the standard `bud` command.
