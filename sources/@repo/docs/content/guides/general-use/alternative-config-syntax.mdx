Out of the box, **bud.js** supports configuration files authored with `json5` and `yml`. `ts` support is relatively easy to add.

## Static config (json or yml)

Bud supports configuration using static config files, although the API is slightly more limited. Bud supports `json` and `yml` as static config options.

If using `json` your config file will be parsed with json5. This means you can use comments, trailing commas, etc.

### Create a static config file

Create either a `bud.config.json` or `bud.config.yml` in the root of your project (or `config` directory).

### Working with a static config

Config function names are used as keys. Their values are used as function parameters.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yml"
  values={[
    {label: 'yml', value: 'yml'},
    {label: 'json', value: 'json'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yml">

```yml title="bud.config.yml"
entry:
  app:
    - index.js
    - index.css
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json">

```json5 title="bud.config.json"
{
  /**
   * You can include comments in json configs
   */
  entry: {
    // keys do not need to be quoted
    app: ['index.js', 'index.css'],
  },
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Limitations

Things to think about:

- If you need to specify a callback or anything that isn't a simple primitive as a parameter a static config is not for you.
- Static configurations will likely never have total parity with JavaScript configurations due to inherent limitations.

## TypeScript

You can use TypeScript to configure your build. In general we would recommend using JavaScript with typedoc comments, but TypeScript is supported with a couple caveats.

### Configuration

TypeScript 4.7.2 offers two new TypeScript extensions to deal with CJS/ESM compatibility issues: .cts and .mts (they have their own declaration file extensions as well: .d.cts and .d.mts).

Depending on your project, you want to use one of the following

| Extension      | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bud.config.ts  | Project has opted in to ESM with `{type: module}`      |
| bud.config.mts | Project has not opted in to ESM but is using `import`  |
| bud.config.cts | Project has not opted in to ESM and is using `require` |

### ts-bud

When configuring bud.js with TypeScript you must use `ts-bud` rather than the standard `bud` command.
