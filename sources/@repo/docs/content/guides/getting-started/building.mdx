import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

We can use the [`bud build` command](/guides/bud-cli/build) to run our first build.

:::success

Nope, you didn't miss a step. No configuration is needed as long you have something at **src/index.js**.

:::

<Tabs
  groupId="pacman"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    yarn bud build

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm run bud build

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see receipt of what was built in your terminal

```shell {3} title='$ bud build'
bud
