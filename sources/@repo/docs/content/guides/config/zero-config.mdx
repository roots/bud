import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition'

If you have a simple project that just needs to move a couple scripts from a source
directory to one for distributables then bud.js is arguably a perfect fit.

## Add or import code in `./src/index.js`

By default, bud.js will try and compile `./src/index.js`. You can treat this module
as the root of your application.

Do you need to include CSS? Import it in `./src/index.js`. Same for all of your other assets (assuming bud.js supports it, and it probably does).

## Zero config example

It's kind of hard to show what zero-config looks like. But, it's not impossible.

<Admonition type="danger" icon="😳" title="Hey, wait a minute!">

<p>I'll admit that we cheated a little bit and passed two CLI flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>--html</b> so that you can see the demo
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>--clean</b> so that the demo's `./dist` folder stays tidy.
  </li>
</ul>

</Admonition>
