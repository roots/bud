Bud supports configuration using static config files, although the API is slightly more limited. Bud supports `json` and `yml` as static config options.

## Create a static config file

Create either a `bud.config.json` or `bud.config.yml` in your project root.

## Working with a static config

Generally speaking, config function names can be used as keys. Their values serve as function parameters.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yml"
  values={[
    {label: 'yml', value: 'yml'},
    {label: 'json', value: 'json'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yml">

```yml title="bud.config.yml"
entry:
  app:
    - index.js
    - index.css
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json">

```json5 title="bud.config.json"
{
  /**
   * You can include comments in json configs
   */
  entry: {
    // keys do not need to be quoted
    app: ['index.js', 'index.css'],
  },
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Considerations

Things to think about:

- You can't do a bunch of stuff in a static config. If you need to specify a callback or anything that isn't a simple primitive as a parameter a static config is not for you. You should use a JavaScript or TypeScript config.
- Static configurations will likely never have total parity with JavaScript or TypeScript configurations. It's just not on the roadmap.
