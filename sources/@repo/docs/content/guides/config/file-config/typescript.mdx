You can use TypeScript to configure your build for instant feedback and added assurance that you're on track.

### Create a bud.config.ts file

TypeScript 4.7.2 offers two new TypeScript extensions to deal with CJS/ESM compatibility issues: .cts and .mts (they have their own declaration file extensions as well: .d.cts and .d.mts).

Depending on your project, you want to use one of the following

| Extension      | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bud.config.ts  | Project has opted in to ESM with `{type: module}`      |
| bud.config.mts | Project has not opted in to ESM but is using `import`  |
| bud.config.cts | Project has not opted in to ESM and is using `require` |

### Annotate your config

You can import the `Bud` type from **@roots/bud**.

```ts {1} title='bud.config.ts'
import type {Bud} from '@roots/bud'
```

That's it!
