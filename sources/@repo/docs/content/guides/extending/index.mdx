You can add additional functionality to **bud.js** using the extensions API.

## Extension shape

Extensions can be provided as either a plain JS object or a class.

```ts title="extension.ts"
const MyExtension = {
  register: async(app, options) {}
}
```

Extensions writen using JS classes should extend the `Extension` base class (exported from `@roots/bud-framework/extension`).

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public async register() {}
}
```

The rest of this document assumes that extensions are being authored as a class and are being exported from an ESM package.

## Interface

Any extension method from the Extension base class prefixed with an underscore should be considered private. This method needs to be public
for compatibility with class decorators, but it is not intended to be used as a public method. These methods can and will change without notice.

### label

The extension `label` serves as a handle for other extensions or the user config.
For a "top-level" extension (listed in the user's `package.json` manifest), the label should match the extension's `package.json` `name` field.

A `label` is not strictly required but extensions without a `label` will have a unique id generated for them. Because this id is generated there is no
straight forward way to reference the extension from the outside.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'
}
```

### dependsOn

Extensions may depend on other other extensions. For instance, if you are authoring an extension that manages postcss plugins then your extension
depends on the presence of `@roots/bud-postcss`. To ensure dependencies are available, you may list their `label`s in a `dependsOn` public property.

The `dependsOn` property is expressed as a `Set`:

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public dependsOn = new Set(['@roots/bud-postcss'])
}
```

### dependsOnOptional

Extensions may depend on other extensions on an optional basis. Bud will attempt to register the extension if it is available. Otherwise, it will silently proceed.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public dependsOnOptional = new Set(['@roots/bud-postcss'])
}
```

### optIn

Extensions may depend on other extensions on an opt-in basis. Bud will attempt to register the extension if it is available _and_ included in the root `devDependencies` or `dependencies`. Otherwise, it will skip it and silently proceed.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public optIn = new Set(['@roots/bud-postcss'])
}
```

### options

Any extension options can be set in the `options` property.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public options = {
    option: 'value',
  }
}
```

The `options` property is treated specially (using `getters` and `setters`).

Each option value can be expressed as either the literal value itself or a function receives the `Bud` object and returns the value.

This is useful when you can't know the value up front (as is the case with user paths):

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public options = {
    option: (bud: Bud) => bud.path('@src'),
  }
}
```

Now, if the user makes a change to the `@src` path, the reference will be updated in the extension.

The only "gotcha" here is that if you have an extension option which is itself callable, you will need to account for that. Otherwise, bud will try to call the
option fn.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

const callback = (prop: string): string => 'hello, world!'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public options = {
    option: () => callback,
  }
}
```

Also note, the extension options are **read only**. There are helpers in the base class to assist you with update `options`:

#### setOption

```ts title="extension.js"
extension.setOptions('foo', (bud: Bud) => 'could have been a string')
```

#### setOptions

```ts title="extension.js"
extension.setOptions({
  foo: 'literal',
  bar: (bud: Bud) => 'a callback is fine, as well'.
})
```

### init

Async callback. Called first. Useful to avoid needing to deal with `super` and the constructor.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public async init(app, options) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

### register

Async callback. Try to do things in this method, when possible.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public async register(app, options) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

### boot

Async callback. Called after `register`. Good for business which requires another
extension to have already had `register` called on it.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public async boot(app, options) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

### afterConfig

Async callback. Called after user configuration has been processed.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public async afterConfig(app, options) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

### beforeBuild

Async callback. Called directly before configuration is constructed and passed to the compiler).

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public async beforeBuild(app, options) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

### make

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import {bind} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension/decorators'
import Plugin from 'some-webpack-plugin'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  @bind
  public async make() {
    return new Plugin(this.options)
  }

  public options = {
    option: (bud: Bud) => bud.path('@src'),
  }
}
```

### plugin

A plugin constructor. Will be passed the extension options. Used in lieue of [make](#make).

A plugin is defined as a newable class or function returning an object with an `apply` method. Here is how **bud.js** types it:

```ts title="extension.d.ts"
/**
 * Webpack plugin.
 *
 * @public
 */
export interface ApplyPlugin {
  /**
   * Loose defined
   *
   * @public
   */
  [key: string]: any

  /**
   * Apply callback
   *
   * @see {@link https://webpack.js.org/contribute/writing-a-plugin/#basic-plugin-architecture}
   *
   * @public
   */
  apply: (compiler?: Compiler) => unknown
}

/**
 * Newable function or class that returns
 * an {@link ApplyPlugin} instance.
 *
 * @public
 */
export interface ApplyPluginConstructor {
  new (...args: any[]): ApplyPlugin
}
```

And here is how you might use it:

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import Plugin from 'some-webpack-plugin'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public plugin = Plugin

  public options = {
    option: (bud: Bud) => bud.path('@src'),
  }
}
```

### apply

An `apply` method indicates to **bud.js** that the extension is doing double duty as a compiler plugin and a bud extension.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import Plugin from 'some-webpack-plugin'

export default class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'bud-extension'

  public apply() {
    // see webpack documentation. this is treated exactly the same as a pure webpack plugin.
  }
}
```

When present **bud.js** will pass the extension itself to the compiler's `plugin` array.
