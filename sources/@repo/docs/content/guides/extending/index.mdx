You can add additional functionality to **bud.js** using the extensions API.

## Discoverability

If authoring a module, include a `bud` field to mark the module as an extension. This field will be
checked when resolving project packages. Without this, the extension won't be imported!

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "bud": {
    "type": "extension"
  }
}
```

## Extension formats

Extensions can be provided as either a plain JS object or a class.

```ts title="extension.ts"
const MyExtension = {
  register: async(app, options) {}
}
```

Extensions writen using JS classes should extend the `Extension` base class (exported from `@roots/bud-framework/extension`).

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public async register() {}
}
```

The rest of this document assumes that extensions are being authored as a class.

## Binding extension methods

If your extension method references the class context (`this`), you should bind it to the class instance.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public constructor(...params) {
    super(...params)
    this.register = this.register.bind(this)
  }

  public async register() {}
}
```

Alternatively, you can use [the `@bind` decorator](/guides/extending/decorators#bind).

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import {bind} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension/decorators'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  @bind
  public async register() {}
}
```

## Interface

### label

The extension `label` serves as a handle for other extensions or the user config.
For a "top-level" extension (listed in the user's `package.json` manifest), the label should match the extension's `package.json` `name` field.

A `label` is not strictly required but extensions without a `label` will have a unique id generated for them. Because this id is generated there is no
straight forward way to reference the extension from the outside.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'
}
```

### dependsOn

Extensions may depend on other other extensions. For instance, if you are authoring an extension that manages postcss plugins then your extension
depends on the presence of `@roots/bud-postcss`. To ensure dependencies are available, you may list their `label`s in a `dependsOn` public property.

The `dependsOn` property is expressed as a `Set`:

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public dependsOn = new Set(['@roots/bud-postcss'])
}
```

### dependsOnOptional

Extensions may also depend on other extensions on an optional basis. Bud will attempt to register the extension if it is available, otherwise it will silently proceed.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public dependsOnOptional = new Set(['@roots/bud-postcss'])
}
```

### options

Any extension options can be set in the `options` property.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public options = {
    option: 'value',
  }
}
```

The `options` property is treated specially (using `getters` and `setters`).

Each option value can be expressed as either the literal value itself or a function receives the `Bud` object and returns the value.

This is useful when you can't know the value up front (as is the case with user paths):

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public options = {
    option: (app: Bud) => app.path('@src'),
  }
}
```

Now, if the user makes a change to the `@src` path, the reference will be updated in the extension.

The only "gotcha" here is that if you have an extension option which is itself callable, you will need to account for that. It should be as simple
as wrapping the option in a function.

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'

const callback = (prop: string): string => 'hello, world!'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public options = {
    option: () => callback,
  }
}
```

Also note, the extension options are **read only**. There are helpers in the base class to assist you with update `options`:

#### setOption

```ts title="extension.js"
extension.setOptions('foo', (app: Bud) => 'could have been a string')
```

#### setOptions

```ts title="extension.js"
extension.setOptions({
  foo: 'literal',
  bar: (app: Bud) => 'a callback is fine, as well'.
})
```

### init

Async callback. Called first.

### register

Async callback. Called second.

### boot

Async callback. Called third.

### beforeBuild

Async callback. Called after user configuration has been processed (directly before configuration is constructed and passed to the compiler).

### make

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import {bind} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension/decorators'
import Plugin from 'some-webpack-plugin'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  @bind
  public async make() {
    return new Plugin(this.options)
  }

  public options = {
    option: (app: Bud) => app.path('@src'),
  }
}
```

### plugin

A plugin constructor. Will be passed the extension options. Used in lieue of [make](#make).

```ts title="extension.ts"
import {Bud} from '@roots/bud-framework'
import {Extension} from '@roots/bud-framework/extension'
import Plugin from 'some-webpack-plugin'

class MyExtension extends Extension {
  public label = 'my-extension'

  public plugin = Plugin

  public options = {
    option: (app: Bud) => app.path('@src'),
  }
}
```
