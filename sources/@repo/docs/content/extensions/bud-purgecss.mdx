# @roots/bud-purgecss

By default, bud does not purge any styles on its own. [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) support can be added by installing the [@roots/bud-purgecss](/extensions/bud-purgecss) extension.

## Installation

[purgecss-with-wordpress](https://purgecss.com/guides/wordpress.html) is optional but recommended when working with WordPress.

<Install packages="@roots/bud-purgecss purgecss-with-wordpress" />

## Configuration

```ts title="bud.config.js"
import purgeCssWordPress from `purgecss-with-wordpress`

bud.purgecss({
  content: [bud.path(`resources/views/**`)],
  safelist: [...purgeCssWordPress.safelist],
})
```
