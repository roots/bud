[@roots/bud-imagemin](/extensions/bud-imagemin) optimizes image filesizes.

The extension uses [squoosh](https://squoosh.app) under the hood and can be configured for
lossless or lossy compression.

## Installation

<Install packages="@roots/bud-imagemin" />

## Configuration

Without any configuration, the image minimizer extension will compress many image asset types and compress them very well.

To compress assets losslessly:

```ts
bud.imagemin('lossless')
```

To compress assets in a lossy manner:

```ts
bud.imagemin('lossy')
```

### Custom config

To provide your own configuration options you can pass a callback which
will receive and should return the `web`.

```ts
bud.imagemin(options => ({
  ...options,
  // ...override
}))
```

You could use this function to provide your own `implementation` if you would prefer to use something other than squoosh.
