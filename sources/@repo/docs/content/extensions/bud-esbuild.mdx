[Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) support can be added by installing the **@roots/bud-esbuild** extension.

## Installation

<Install packages="@roots/bud-esbuild" />

## Details

- Supports `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` files.
- Does not support typechecking.

## Typechecking

:::danger Incompatible with TypeScript config files

**bud.js** requires **ts-node** in order to parse configuration files authored in TypeScript at build time. Unfortunately, fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin is Incompatible
with this setup. You'll need to author your configuration file without TypeScript support.

:::

Typechecking can be added with [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin).

```ts
import Plugin from 'fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin'

export default bud => {
  await bud.extensions.add(Plugin)
}
```
