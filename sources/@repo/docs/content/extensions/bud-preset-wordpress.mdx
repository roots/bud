The [@roots/bud-preset-wordpress](/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress) package is a great starting point for WordPress plugins & themes.

If you plan on using it in a WordPress theme you should consider using [@roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage).

It includes the following extensisons:

- [@roots/bud-babel](/extensions/bud-babel)
- [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss)
- [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react)
- [@roots/bud-entrypoints](/extensions/bud-entrypoints)
- [@roots/bud-wordpress-manifests](/extensions/bud-wordpress-manifests)

## Installation

<Install packages="@roots/bud-preset-wordpress" />

## Registering blocks

In your entrypoint call `import.meta.blocks` and provide the path to your blocks directory. If your blocks are in the same directory as your entrypoint you can use `./`.

```js title=src/index.js
/* look for blocks in `./blocks` */
import.meta.blocks('@src/blocks')
```

Block modules must be named with the `.block.js` extension. They should export the block settings and the block name.

Minimal example using a default export:

```js title=src/blocks/example.block.js
export default {
  name: `bud-project/example-block`,
  title: `Example block`,
  edit: () => <div><h1>Hello world!</h1></div>,
}
```

Or using named exports:

```js title=src/blocks/example.block.js
export const name = `bud-project/example-block`
export const title = `Example block`
export const edit = () => <div><h1>Hello world!</h1></div>
```

Named exports are kind of nice because you can re-export from other modules.

```js title-src/blocks/example.block.js
export const name = `bud-project/example-block`
export const title = `Example block`
export {Edit as edit} from './edit.js'
```

That's it! Any `*.block.js` files will be automatically registered in both development and production.
