The [@roots/bud-preset-wordpress](/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress) package is a great starting point for WordPress plugins & themes.

If you plan on using it in a WordPress theme you should consider using [@roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage).

It includes the following extensisons:

- [@roots/bud-postcss](/extensions/bud-postcss)
- [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react)
- [@roots/wordpress-hmr](/extensions/bud-preset-wordpress/editor-integration)

## Installation

```npm2yarn
npm install @roots/bud-preset-wordpress --save-dev
```

## Excluding predefined externals

If WordPress provides a package in your bundle any references you make to it will be replaced by a reference to the WP provided global.

There may be situations where you want to exclude a package from this behavior. For example, you may wish to use a different version of jQuery than the one provided by WordPress.

To that end you can pass an array of packages to exclude:

```ts title=bud.config.ts
export default async (bud: Bud) => {
  bud.wp.externals.exclude(['jquery'])
}
```

With that, your custom jQuery will now be bundled with your application.
