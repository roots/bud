:::note

Extensions documentation is a work-in-progress

:::

Nearly all of the first-party bud extensions are zero config. Once installed, they are immediately and automatically applied.

An exception to this general assumption are extensions which _require_ some sort of configuration â€” like [@roots/bud-library](/extensions/bud-library).

After installing an extension you may wish to run `bud clean` to explicitly remove any cached data. However, Webpack should
register the change in dependencies and automatically invalidate the cache.

### What do the colors in the sidebar mean?

They indicate our level of confidence in the extension.

Semantically, it's probably close to what you'd assume:

#### ðŸŸ¢ green

We have a working version of the extension with _at least_ partial unit/integration test coverage.
This extension sees relatively broad usage and is being used in production.

#### ðŸŸ¡ yellow

This extension is simple and likely runs in a predictable way but either has limited unit/integration
test coverage or does not see broad production usage. Any issue with this extension will be taken seriously.

#### ðŸ”´ red

This is an experimental extension. It likely has no tests written for it. It is our intent to improve it
over time but it may not be a top priority.
