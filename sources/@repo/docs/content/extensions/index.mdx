Nearly all of the first-party bud.js extensions are zero config. Once installed, they are immediately and automatically applied.

If an extension does require some configuration to be used it will be documented on the extension page.

After installing an extension you may wish to run your next build with the `--force` flag to explicitly remove any cached artifacts that may be version specific.

All core extensions should have version numbers which exactly match the version of bud.js they are compatible with.
When upgrading an extension or bud.js core take care to ensure that the versions are compatible.

### What do the colors in the sidebar mean?

This is an experimental extension. This extension likely runs in a predictable way but either has limited unit/integration
test coverage or does not see broad production usage. Any issue with this extension will be taken seriously.
