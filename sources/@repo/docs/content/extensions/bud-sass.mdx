[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) support can be added by installing the **@roots/bud-sass** extension.

## Installation

[@roots/bud-sass](/extensions/bud-sass) requires `@roots/bud-postcss` in order to function. As Webpack improves its
support of CSS we may shed this requirement in the future.

<Install packages="@roots/bud-sass @roots/bud-postcss" />
