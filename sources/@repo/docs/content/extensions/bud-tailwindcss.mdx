# @roots/bud-tailwindcss

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.org) support can be added by installing the [@roots/bud-tailwindcss](/extensions/bud-tailwindcss) extension.

## Installation

<Install packages="@roots/bud-tailwindcss --dev" />

## Using tailwind values in JS files

bud.js can be configured to allow for you to import tailwind theme values using the (virtual) `@tailwind/*` alias.

An example:

```typescript
import {black} from '@tailwind/colors'
import {sans} from '@tailwind/fontFamily'

export const main = () => {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = black
  document.body.style.fontFamily = sans
}
```

Generating the imports can be memory intensive and increase build times, so it is opt-in.

```ts
app.tailwind.generateImports()
```

Better to generate imports only for specific keys (much less memory intensive):

```ts
app.tailwind.generateImports([`colors`, `fontFamily`])
```

This is a lot better than trying to import the actual `tailwind.config.js` file to read these values as the values are fully resolved (merged with `defaultTheme`, plugins applied, etc.)

And it's a lot better than importing `tailwindcss/resolveConfig` and doing it in the app code because of transitive dependencies.

Lastly, it's better than pre-compiling a static json file because these values are tree-shakeable. The entire generated json for the default tailwind config is ~100kb.
The above example adds ~5kb to the overall bundle (and only because tailwind has so many default colors). If you use terser ([bud.minify](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.minimize)) the difference is entirely negligible.

If you don't import from `@tailwind/*` nothing is added to the bundle (even if the imports are generated)
