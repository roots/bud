# @roots/bud-library

The [@roots/bud-library](/extensions/bud-library) extension adds the ability to create a long-lived, highly-cacheable DLL from a list of modules.

Modules can be added to the DLL using the **bud.library** function.

The first build will likely take longer as the DLL will need to be compiled, but subsequent builds should see a noticeable reduction in build time.

## Installation

<Install packages="@roots/bud-library" />

## Usage

Pass `bud.library` the module you would like to add to the DLL cache:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.library('jquery')
```

Multiple modules can be added using an array:

```js title='bud.config.js'
bud.library(['jquery', 'bootstrap'])
```
