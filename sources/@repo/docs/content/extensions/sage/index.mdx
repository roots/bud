## Acorn compatibility

[roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) is built with the [roots/acorn](https://github.com/roots/acorn) framework. This preset guarantees compatibility with Acorn's API for enqueuing JS and CSS.

If you do not wish to use Acorn to enqueue assets you can disable the Acorn extension:

```ts title=bud.config.ts
export default async (bud: Bud) => {
  bud.sage.acorn.enable(false)
}
```

This will restore the default behavior of including the public path (e.g. `/app/themes/sage/public`) in entrypoints manifest values.
