**bud.proxy** is a method that configures a proxy server for your development environment. This is useful when you need to proxy requests to a backend server, such as a WordPress site.

If you only need to modify the [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) of the proxy server you should consider using [bud.setProxyUrl](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.setProxyUrl) and [bud.setPublicProxyUrl](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.setPublicProxyUrl).
