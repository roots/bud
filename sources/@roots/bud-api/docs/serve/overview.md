**bud.serve** is used to configure the development server.

You don't need to call this function unless you want to change the default server configuration.

If you only need to modify the [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) of the dev server you should consider using [bud.setUrl](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.setUrl) and [bud.setPublicUrl](https://bud.js.org/docs/bud.setPublicUrl)
