:::danger Known issue

**`bud.typescript.typecheck.enable()` will die when using `ts-bud`**

It is unclear what the problem is as of right now ([see #1480](https://github.com/roots/bud/issues/1480)). **In order to enable typechecking you must author your config file in JS until this is resolved.**

:::

By default TypeScript files will only be compiled to JS during builds.
If you also want typechecking, you can enable it in your bud configuration:

```js title="bud.config.mjs"
bud.typescript.typecheck.enable()
```
