By default, `@roots/bud-typescript` will pass code to `@roots/bud-babel` for further transforms.

To disable babel and only use tsc:

```ts
bud.typescript.useBabel(false)
```

If you aren't using babel make sure your `tsconfig.json` is set up appropriately.

In particular, React users likely want to set `jsx` to `react`.
