title: Typechecking
---

By default TypeScript files will only be compiled to JS during builds.
If you also want typechecking, you can enable it in your bud configuration:


bud.typescript.typecheck.enable()
```

You may wish to configure typechecking only in production so that your development
experience stays snappy:


bud.isProduction && bud.typescript.typecheck.enable()
```
