title: Usage
---

**@roots/bud-imagemin** works out of the box with no configuration. It uses the [sharp library](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) to optimize images, and sticks to the default options provided by sharp.

This extension is a relatively thin wrapper around the [webpack-contrib/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin). Refer to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin) for more information on how to configure it.
