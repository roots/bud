/**
 * Service
 *
 * @remarks
 * The {@link Service} interface provides access to the {@link Bud} container.
 *
 * A {@link Service} interfaces with the Framework through a series of callbacks at different points in the build.
 *
 * All of the callbacks are optional:
 *
 * - {@link Service.bootstrap} is called when the Service is instantiated (but before all services are guaranteed to be instantiated).
 * - {@link Service.bootstrapped} is called once all Services have been instantiated.
 * - {@link Service.register} is intended for Services to register functionalities, modules, and bind functions and classes.
 * - {@link Service.registered} is called after all {@link Service.register} callbacks are complete.
 * - {@link Service.boot} is called once all services are registered. It should be safe for Services to reference one another.
 * - {@link Service.booted} is called after all {@link Service.boot} callbacks are complete.
