For general information on configuring eslint see [the official Eslint user guide](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).

As a courtesy, there is a recommended eslint configuration available for you to use as a base in your project:

```js title=".eslintrc.cjs"
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ['@roots/eslint-config/recommended'],
}
```
