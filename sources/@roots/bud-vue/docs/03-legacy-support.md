title: Using Vue 2
---

If you are trying to configure **@roots/bud-vue** for use with Vue 2 you will need to install a version of [vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue/v/2.6.14) tagged `legacy` and a compatible version of the [vue-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-loader) and [vue-template-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-template-compiler) packages.

If a custom version of vue is included in the project package.json the extension will automatically detect it and configure itself accordingly.
