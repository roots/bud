  <em>Bud is a high-level webpack framework combining the best parts of Laravel Mix and Symfony Encore.</em>
</h3>

## Overview

This package contains typings for the core Framework packages.

## Details

These types are included separately to allow framework packages and the core
framework to reference types bi-directionally without producing cyclical dependency
issues.

The `packages` directory exists as a merged namespace for frequently utilized,
shared, or otherwise fundamental typings.
