## Overview

This is the core framework leveraged by @roots/bud. You may find it useful in other projects. It's kind of a bootstrap-y laravel/adonis style container-based framework.

## Installation

`yarn add @roots/bud-framework`

## Some things you can do with it

Attach things to it.

```js
import {framework} from '@roots/bud-framework'

framework.apply('method', () =>
  console.log('attach a method to it'),
)

const instance = new framework()

instance.method() // => 'attach a method to it'
```

Log stuff.

```js
instance.logger.info({data: 100}, 'Logged message')
```

Create containers for storing, accessing and manipulating stuff.

```js
instance.bind('things', {
  some: {
    thing: 100,
  },
})

instance.things.get('some.thing')
// => 100

instance.things.set('some.thang', 200)
instance.things.get('some')
// => {some: {thing: 100, thang: 200}}
```

It definitely does other helpful stuff. As this is a lower-level utility it is largely undocumented, at the moment..
