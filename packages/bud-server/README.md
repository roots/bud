## Overview

The compiler provides controls and renders Bud's built-in development server. It is a lower-level utility and there is no reason to include it in your Bud project.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @roots/bud-compiler --dev
```

## Usage

The compiler is called as a function and expects a valid webpack configuration and an instance of Bud.

It returns an object that includes a `compile` function. This initiates the compiler.

```js
const {compiler} = require('@roots/bud-compiler')
const instance = compiler(bud, config)
instance.compile()
```
