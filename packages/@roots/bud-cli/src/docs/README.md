## Running the build in CI

It is possible, depending on your environment, that Bud's CLI output causes issues. In particular, it's usage of tty `raw mode` can cause issues with CI tools.

To run the build but not use the `@roots/bud-cli` renderer, there is a `--ci` flag which indicates you want to run the build for these environments.

## Exiting the CLI from `dev` mode

Type `q` to gracefully exit the interface when running in development mode.
