# bud.setPath

Sets a project location.

It accepts two strings:

- The first is a location registered with the framework. Out-of-the-box these include: `project`, `src`, `dist`, `storage`. It is possible for extensions to register additional locations.

- The second is the path being assigned to this location. If `project` is being defined this path should be absolute. All other paths should be supplied as relative to `project`.

Alternatively, this function may also accept a key-value object, so that multiple locations can be redefined at once.

Once set, this directory may be utilitized using [bud.path](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/stable/docs/config/path.md).

## Usage

Defines the `src` directory as `scripts` (relative to project root).

```js
bud.setPath("src", "scripts");
```

Defines both the `src` and `dist` directories in one call:

```js
bud.setPath({
  src: "scripts",
  dist: "public",
});
```
