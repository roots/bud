        This form is for reporting technical issues.
        If you have a general question or you're looking for support, please visit [Roots Discourse](https://discourse.roots.io/).

        Please attempt the following before filing an issue:
          - Run bud using the `--no-cache` flag to force modules to recompile from scratch.
          - Run `bud clean` to remove any stale `.budfiles`.
          - Run `yarn build` again (even if your problem is not related to the `build` command). This will ensure any submitted files are pertitent to your issue.
          - If, at this point, `.budfiles/bud/profile.json` or `.budfiles/bud/webpack.config.js` have been emitted, please include them in your issue.
