Multi-compiler, SolidJS, and you can utilize Webpack plugins without a wrapper. Yeah, it's a big minor release.

<!--truncate-->

## Breaking

`bud.override` removed. If you want to override the config, use one of the 'build' hooks.

```ts
bud.hooks.on('build/plugins', plugins => [
  ...plugins,
  // override,
])
```

This should technically make v4.7.0 a major release, but `bud.override` was only recently introduced as part of a minor bump and I don't think it's seen broad adoption. So, we're breaking semver for this one.

## Details

This is a feature-rich release. Cheers!

### Solid support

Utilize [Solid](https://solidjs.com) by installing the the [@roots/bud-solid](/extensions/bud-solid) extension. See the /examples directory for a quick start implementation.

### multi-compiler!!

`bud.make` will create a new named child compiler for you to configure.

```d.ts
make(
  key: string,
  tap?: (app: Framework) => Framework,
): Framework
```

The easiest and cleanest way to use this feature is with a callback. It returns the parent compiler instance for fluent chaining.

```ts
bud.make('child', child => 
 child.use(babel).entry('app', 'app.js')
)
```

But you can also work with child compilers in a more hands-on way.

Make a compiler:

```ts
bud.make('child')
```

Get a compiler:

```ts
bud.get('child')
  .entry(...) // we're configuring the child
```

The `bud.parent` property allows you to return to the parent compiler from a child

```ts
bud
  .get('child') 
    .entry('app', 'app.js') // configuring the child
  .parent 
    .use(babel) // configuring the parent
```

### `bud.use` now supports using Webpack plugins directly.

Previously, a `name` property was required for bud extensions. This is still _strongly_ encouraged for extension authors, since it is nice for config maintainers and other extension authors to have a way to reference your extension. However, this is unnecessary for configuration authors who might just want to quickly try out a webpack plugin.

So, previously, a small amount of boilerplate was required to wrap a plugin:

```ts
bud.use({
  name: 'my-webpack-plugin',
  make: new MyWebpackPlugin(),
})
```

But, now you can just use a plugin. A name will be automatically generated.

```ts
bud.use(new MyWebpackPlugin())
```

A side effect of this is that extension authors can now make hybrid bud/webpack extensions:

```ts
const extension = {
  name: 'my-bud-extension',
  apply: (compiler) => {
    // webpack apply
  },
  when: bud => bud.isProduction,
}
```

Note that `extension.apply` overrules `extension.make`. If you include both it won't throw an error or anything, but `extension.make` won't produce a webpack plugin in the final config (unless you call it from `apply` and use webpack apis to add the plugin manually). 

## CLI

First off, it got a fresh coat of paint along with some related performance enhancements:

### New `bud clean` command

Keep your house in order.

`bud clean:dist` - will remove dist directory and contents
`bud clean:storage` - will remove storage directory (.budfiles) and contents
`bud clean:cache` - will remove all cache files but leave the rest of storage untouched
`bud clean:all` - will remove both dist and storage

### New `bud doctor` command

Presently this only dumps your compiled config to the terminal for easier debugging. This will do cooler things one day.

### Updated flags for `bud build`

```sh
OPTIONS
  -c, --cache          cache compiler references to disk
  -d, --debug          produce config artifacts in [storage] dir
  -h, --help           show CLI help
  -l, --log            log to console
  -m, --minimize       minimize file size of compiled assets
  -t, --target=target  limit compilation to this compiler
  --ci                 non raw mode tty interoperable output
  --hash               hash compiled filenames
  --manifest           produce a manifest
```

**--target/-t**

The big one here is `--target`/`-t`, which is intended for use with multi compiler builds. It allows you to limit compilation to particular compilers. You can pass `-t` multiple times. The outermost compiler, if used, is always referred to as `parent`.

For example, if you have three compilers (a `parent`, `theme` and `plugin` compiler), and you're only interested in compiling the `theme`, you can specify that as such:

```sh
bud build -t theme
```

Or, you can request just the `parent` and `plugin` compilers be used:

```sh
bud build -t parent -t plugin
```

**--cache/-c**

Pretty much the same as calling `bud.persist()`. This will enable using a filesystem based cache from the cli, which is desirable since sometimes the caching can still be a bit wacky and it's a hard issue to reliably reproduce. If you do notice anything weird, it's a lot easier to run the build without a CLI flag than editing `persist()` out of your config. Side note, if removing the cache flag helps, usually cleaning out the cache (`bud clean:storage`) will resolve the issue.  

## Notification center

This is a macOS only feature for now. I'm sure we will bring this feature to linux and winboxes soon we just want to do it right. We did MacOS right.

There is only be one notification produced per project. Subsequent notifications, if the preceding notification has not been dismissed, will replace the existing notification rather than stacking infinitely. There are 11 stacked notifications in this screenshot because there are 11 integration tests in the repo right now.
