**bud** is designed to be a CLI but it is possible to use it as a node API directly. This makes it easier to:

- Use **bud** as part of an existing pipeline like gulp
- Use **bud** to generate a configuration to be consumed by **webpack** directly
- Modify **bud** before running a build.

## Using Bud with Node

The easiest way to get going is calling the **factory** helper exported from **@roots/bud**.

```js
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()
```

You may wish to override Bud services, its base configuration, or programatically set 
the compiler mode to `production` or `development`. These can all be specified with optional factory config properties.

You may wish to import the `config` and `services` objects from `@roots/bud` to merge your overrides with 
the defaults. This way, you don't have to reimplement the entire framework.

```js
import {config, factory, services} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory({
  name: 'bud'
  mode: 'production'
  config: {
    ...config,
    // config overrides
  },
  services: {
    ...services,
    // service overrides
  }
})
```

The return value of **factory** is an instance of **Bud**, just as it is passed to `bud.config.js` when using the CLI.
Configuration from that point on should be identical, with the exception of running the build and/or development server.

## Running a build from Node

Once configured, simply call **bud.run** to run the build. In `development` the server will be instantiated for you. If you would like
to handle that yourself for some reason check out the source for **bud.run**.

```js
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()

app.entry('app', 'app.js').run()
```

## Exporting a webpack config

You may also want to utilize **bud** to create a config to be used with **webpack** directly. 
This is easily accomplished by exporting the **bud.build.config** accessor from a file called `webpack.config.js`.

```js title='webpack.config.js'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()
const config = app.entry('app', 'app.js').build.config

export default config
```

Now you can use the webpack cli as per their documentation to run your build while still taking advantage of all
the quality of life improvements afforded by `bud`.
