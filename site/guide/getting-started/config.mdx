# Configuring our build

So far we've been working without a configuration file which is easy but not very flexible. In this guide we'll add a config file to our build so that we have a little more control.

## Create bud.config.js

Create a file named **bud.config.js** file in the project root. This file exports a single function that will tell **bud** to serve our js using bud's built-in html template.

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud => bud.template()
```

:::info bud.config.js isn't the only way

You can also configure your project with json or yml. We won't be covering that now but it is an option you might want to look into later.

:::

With our config file in place, start the development server.

```shell
yarn bud dev
```

Your site is now available to view in browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Open **src/index.js** and make some edits: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## Adding a new entrypoint

What if we want to add another script to our project, which should be built and output separately? It's simple.

Let's say we add the following script to our project at **src/landing.js**:

```js title='src/landing.js'
console.log('landing page script')
```

We'll specify the new script in **bud.config.js** using **bud.entry**:

```js {3} title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud =>
  bud
    .entry('landing', 'landing.js')
    .template()
```

If you run a build now you'll see your new file was compiled, but you might also notice that **dist/main.js** is missing.

At first, we were relying on bud's implicit inclusion of **src/index.js**. But now that we are specifying an entrypoint, we'll need
to explicitly specify the original file as well.

```js {3} title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud =>
  bud
    .entry('main', 'index.js')
    .entry('landing', 'landing.js')
    .template()
```

Bud won't provide any entry defaults once we start configuring entrypoints for ourselves.

## Adding files to an existing entrypoint

Currently, we are importing our application css by importing it into the **src/index.js** entrypoint. This is a totally valid way to handle css in your build,
but let's say we didn't want to do this and instead specify the css file in **bud.config.js**.

Start by removing the import from **src/index.js**

```js {1-2} title='src/index.js'


console.log('hello world!')
```

And instead add the css to the **main** entry. It's second parameter can take either a **string** or an **array**, and we'll use the latter to specify multiple files.

```js {3} title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud =>
  bud
    .entry('main', ['index.js', 'index.css'])
    .entry('landing', 'landing.js')
    .template()
```

## Next steps

The rest of this section deals with alternative ways to configure bud beyond `bud.config.js`.
