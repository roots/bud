# Developing

You can run the build in development mode for hot module reloading.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    yarn bud dev

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm run bud dev

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see receipt of what was built in your terminal

```shell {3} title='$ bud build'
bud

- main.js         minimized          56 bytes
- main.css        minimized          51 bytes

Compiled in 486ms
```

Try making a change in **src/index.js**. You should see your terminal update with the most recent changes after you save.

## Next steps

For anything beyond the simplest projects, you'll likely need to provide some configuration, which [we'll do in the next step](/guide/getting-started/config).
