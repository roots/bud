# Configuring with TypeScript

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with [configuring bud using vanilla JS](/guide/getting-started/config).

:::

You can use TypeScript to configure your build for instant feedback and added assurance that you're on track.

:::tip You can do this!

This sounds annoying and complicated but its actually pretty easy to set up and makes configuring bud a lot more intuitive in editors with typechecking support (like VSCode). It doesn't mean you have to convert your project to TypeScript.

:::

## Requirements

You'll need to install TypeScript in your project.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    yarn add typescript --dev

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm install typescript --save-dev

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Depending on your project structure there may be additional, TypeScript specific steps (although hopefully you're good to go). 

If you have problems you should refer to the TS docs for more information on configuring TypeScript.

## Create a bud.config.ts file

Create a **bud.config.ts** file in your project root. If you already have a **bud.config.js** file, change the extension.

:::warning 

Bud configuration files are not mutually exclusive. If you have both a **bud.config.js** file and a **bud.config.ts** file in your project root, 
both configurations will be applied to your build. Things will probably still work fine, but any issues that may crop up will likely be hard to 
debug. You should save yourself possible headaches and pick a flavor.

:::

## Annotate your config

You can import the `Framework` type from **@roots/bud**.

```ts {1} title='bud.config.ts'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'
```

## Utilize a default export

Rather than using `module.exports` syntax, use a default export.

```ts {3} title='bud.config.ts'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'

export default (bud: Framework): Framework => 
  bud
    .entry('main', 'index.js')
    .template()
```

That's it!
