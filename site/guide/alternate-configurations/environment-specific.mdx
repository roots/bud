# Environment limited configuration

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with [configuring bud using vanilla JS](/guide/getting-started/config).

:::

Bud has tools to deal with `production` and `development` builds of your project. But, you can also create configuration files which are only applied for certain builds.

For instance, if you have configuration which only applies to development builds you can create a file called `bud.config.development.js` in the root of your project. It works just like
`bud.config.js` except it is only applied in development.

Environment specific configs are compatible with any supported configuration type (js, ts, yml, or json).

You can utilize any number of supported configs in the same project.

So, if you want to use `bud.config.ts` as a base config, and then create `bud.config.development.ts` and `bud.config.production.ts` for your environment specific requirements,
that's totally doable. Each of the environment limited configs will be used in their respective environments, and the base config will always be applied regardless.
