# Static configuration

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with [configuring bud using vanilla JS](/guide/getting-started/config).

:::

Bud also supports configuration using static config files, although the API is slightly more limited. Bud supports `json` and `yml` as static config options.

## Create a static config file

Create either a `bud.config.json` or `bud.config.yml` in your project root.

## Working with a static config

Generally speaking, config function names can be used as keys. Their values serve as function parameters.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yml"
  values={[
    {label: 'yml', value: 'yml'},
    {label: 'json', value: 'json'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yml">

  ```yml title="bud.config.yml"
  entry:
    app: 
      - index.js
      - index.css
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json">

  ```json title="bud.config.json"
  {
    "entry": {
      "app": [
        "index.js",
        "index.css"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Things to think about:

- You can't do a bunch of stuff in a static config. If you need to specify a callback or anything that isn't a simple primitive as a parameter a static config is not for you. You should use a JavaScript or TypeScript config.
- Static configurations will likely never have parity with JavaScript or TypeScript configurations. It's just not on the roadmap.
- yml is about ten times slower to parse than any other config type.

## Extensions

Extensions are a special case for static config, as we can't import them. Normally, we'd point to the list of caveats above and say "static configs simply do not support this". 

But, without extensions bud is very limited, and static configurations are nice if the project is otherwise compatible, so we've made an exception and provided an alternative to [bud.use](/docs/bud.use) for static configs.

Instead of bud.use, use the `extensions` key and pass the package name as a string. Bud will resolve it from there.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yml"
  values={[
    {label: 'yml', value: 'yml'},
    {label: 'json', value: 'json'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yml">

  ```yml title="bud.config.yml"
  extensions:
    - '@roots/bud-babel'
  entry:
    app: 
      - index.js
      - index.css
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json">

  ```json title="bud.config.json"
  {
    "extensions": [
      "@roots/bud-babel"
    ],
    "entry": {
      "app": [
        "index.js",
        "index.css"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

This may not play nicely with yarn 2/3 or other pnp solutions. We will not support these use cases.
