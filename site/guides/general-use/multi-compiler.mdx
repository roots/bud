It is possible to configure more than one Webpack compiler from a single bud config file.

For a single page app this isn't really that useful. However, for WordPress or a Symfony app &mdash; anything with very different
needs for its marketing pages and administrative interfaces &mdash; it is potentially very useful.

## In practice

To specify a new child instance, we can use [bud.make](/docs/bud.make). It is a function that accepts two parameters: a name for the instance
(so we can refer to it later), and a callback that is identical to the standard `bud.config.js` module-level function.

In this example we're creating two instances of bud: one for `theme` code and another for `plugin` code.

    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},

  ]}>
  <TabItem value="js">

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = app =>
  app
    .make('theme', theme =>
      theme
        .use(require('@roots/bud-babel'))
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
        .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css']),
    )
    .make('plugin', plugin =>
      plugin
        .use([
          require('@roots/bud-babel'),
          require('@roots/bud-react'),
        ])
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/plugin')
        .entry('plugin', ['plugin.js', 'plugin.css']),
    )
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ts">

```ts title='bud.config.ts'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'
import Babel from '@roots/bud-babel'
import React from '@roots/bud-react'

export default (app: Framework): void =>
  app
    .make('theme', (theme: Framework): void => {
      theme
        .use(Babel)
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
        .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css'])
    })
    .make('plugin', (plugin: Framework): void =>
      plugin
        .use([Babel, React])
        .setPath('dist', 'dist/plugin')
        .entry('plugin', ['plugin.js', 'plugin.css']),
    )
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There is an implicit benefit to structuring our config this way: our `plugin` compiler uses [@roots/bud-react](/extensions/bud-react),
but our `theme` compiler does not. Ideally, tree-shaking would make it so that react code didn't make it into our theme but now that we've separated our
build into two distinct compilations we've all but guaranteed that it won't.

## Improved workflow with `--target`

The other benefit is a potentially massive workflow improvement. Let's say that we have to work on the `theme` more often than the `plugin`.
With the above config we don't have to rebuild the `plugin` code again just to work on our `theme` code.

We can use the `bud` cli to only run the compiler we need using [the `--target` flag](/guides/bud-cli/build#--target).

So, to only rebuild the `theme`:

<CodeBlock title="$ yarn bud build --target theme">
  {BuildTargetTheme}
</CodeBlock>

If you had more than two instances it might make sense to want to target more than one compiler, and `--target` supports that:

<CodeBlock title="$ yarn bud build --target theme --target plugin">
  {BuildTargetThemePlugin}
</CodeBlock>

## Compilers can only be made from the parent context

You cannot create a child compiler from a child compiler. So, don't do this:

```js title='bud.config.js' {9-13}
module.exports = app =>
  app.make('theme', theme => {
    theme
      .use([require('@roots/bud-babel')])
      .setPath('dist', 'dist/theme')
      .entry('theme', ['theme.js', 'theme.css'])

      .make('invalid', grandchild => {
        /**
         * `theme` cannot create a child compiler. only `app` can.
         */
      })
  })
```

If you try this the cli will present you with a certificate of failure and the process will exit.
